Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2017 first quarter ended December 31, 2016. The Company posted all-time record quarterly revenue of $78.4 billion and all-time record quarterly earnings per diluted share of $3.36. These results compare to revenue of $75.9 billion and earnings per diluted share of $3.28 in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 64 percent of the quarter’s revenue.
“We’re thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple’s highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Revenue from Services grew strongly over last year, led by record customer activity on the App Store, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline.”
“Our outstanding business performance resulted in a new all-time record for earnings per share, and over $27 billion in operating cash flow,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “We returned nearly $15 billion to investors through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter, bringing cumulative payments through our capital return program to over $200 billion.”
Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2017 second quarter:

    revenue between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion
    gross margin between 38 percent and 39 percent
    operating expenses between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion
    other income/(expense) of $400 million
    tax rate of 26 percent

Apple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of the Company’s common stock.  The dividend is payable on February 16, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 13, 2017.
Apple will provide live streaming of its Q1 2017 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PST on January 31, 2017 at www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/. This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately two weeks thereafter.

For today’s edition of Dear Mark, I’m answering two questions. First up, do the nutrient contents of hydroponic produce differ from soil-grown produce? If so, in what way? Then I give a few (somehwat unprompted) tips for lowering blood pressure without meds. While meds can and do help people overcome or mitigate hypertension, we should apply other options. What are these possibilities?

Hydroponic: more room for things to go right or wrong. The mineral content of a hydroponically-grown leaf of spinach depends entirely on the minerals added to the growth solution. If the grower is clueless, their product will be less nutritious. If you’ve got a hydroponic grower who knows what they’re doing, it can be great. They can even use hydroponic systems to incorporate nutrients we require but inadequately obtain (like iodine) into vegetables that normally don’t provide it (like lettuce).

What about polyphenols and other antioxidant compounds? Many of these vitamins and antioxidants are defense mechanisms for the plants. The more stress they endure, they higher the levels. The more cultivated and controlled your operation gets, the lower the levels. So wild (“uncultivated”) greens have higher carotenoid content than conventional (“cultivated”) greens, and hydro leafy greens have been shown to have significantly lower levels of carotenoids, including lutein, beta-carotene, neoxanthin, and violaxanthin, than conventionally grown greens.

Soybeans grown in hydroponic conditions have more fat and fiber than their conventional counterparts, but fewer phytochemicals.

Hydroponic vegetables appear to have more nitrates than other varieties. Some authors paint this as a negative, yet I see it as a boon; nitrate begets nitric oxide, which improves vascular function and health.

All in all, there are some differences. If hydroponic farming ever takes off and provides a sizeable portion of the food we eat, I can only imagine the growers would innovate and replicate . Maybe hormetic doses of pests applied to boost polyphenols.

    Mark, Blood Pressure Meds. So many of my contemporaries are on BP meds, and I just got advised by my doc to start. I’ve been Primal for 4-5 years and read all your posts, but don’t recall anything on this widespread problem/question. Please advise. Bill

Going Primal or paleo fixes blood pressure issues for many, but it’s not a panacea. There are some quick tweaks and hacks a person can enact, many of which a Primal devotee might be missing or unaware of. If anything strikes a chord, give it a try and report back.

    Eat more protein. Higher protein intakes consistently reduce blood pressure, especially compared to higher carb intakes.
    Eat more whey protein. Whey protein in particular has powerful effects on blood pressure. A recent paper found that whey protein (56 grams a day in two doses) improved 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in “prehypertensives” and “mild hypertensives” (categories you may fall into).
    Reduce salt if salt-sensitive. Some people are salt-sensitives—extra salt increases blood pressure. But that’s not everyone, and at any rate the singular attention paid to sodium intake does a disservice to all the other interventions that work. I’ve already written a couple posts about the relationship between salt intake and blood pressure, so go read those.
    Eat your fruits and veggies. Everyone talks about sodium and blood pressure. Equally or more important is potassium, which is primarily found in produce. People with hypertension who eat the most potassium enjoy around a 7-point drop in systolic blood pressure and a 2-point drop in diastolic blood pressure.. Unfortunately, the official recommendations for sodium and potassium intake cannot be met simultaneously. Something’s gotta give, and I suggest focusing your efforts on eating lots of potassium (potatoes, sweet potatoes, leafy greens, bananas).
    Don’t eat excessive carbohydrates. Now “excessive” is relative to how much glycogen you burn. CrossFitters and elite athletes will have higher ceilings. So will pregnant and nursing women. Office workers probably have lower needs. Only eat what you earn or require.
    Get more insulin sensitive. If you’re insulin resistant, you’ll secrete more insulin in response to carbohydrate than someone who’s insulin sensitive, and elevated levels of insulin are consistent and early predictors of hypertension. If you’re not doing at least half of the recommendations in this post, you’re selling your endothelia function short. Until you’re able to improve insulin sensitivity (or enact the lifestyle modifications that promote it), stick to low-carb eating to reduce the insulin load.
    Eat beets. Beets are a dense source of nitrates, which improve blood pressure.
    Eat nitrates if you hate beets. Yes, it’s not just “natural” beet-borne nitrates that improve blood pressure. Non-organic sodium nitrate—the stuff commonly used to cure bacon—also reduces blood pressure.
    Choose your carbs wisely. White rice has negligible amounts of minerals. A white potato has tons of potassium and a decent amount of magnesium.
    Address your anxiety. That acute anxiety increases blood pressure acutely is adaptive, reflecting the urgent delivery of blood-borne nutrients and energy to cells around the body to increase readiness in stressful situations. It only becomes a problem when the anxiety grows chronic, when everything puts you on edge. A recent study found that having an anxiety disorder increases the risk of developing hypertension by 4.14.
    Drink hibiscus tea, which lowers blood pressure in pre-hypertensives, type 2 diabetics, and Nigerians with mild hypertension. That last one found hibiscus tea to be more effective than diuretic drugs, without the electrolyte imbalance. A recent review of the evidence agrees: hibiscus tea works.
    Sleep. Adequate sleep lowers blood pressure. No sleep does the opposite. And when you make a habit of poor sleep, even a good night’s sleep has less of a beneficial effect on your blood pressure.
    Meditate (or the equivalent for you). Stress is a major inducer of hypertension. As with anxiety, stress-related hypertension is fleeting and fairly normal. Regular meditation (or, again, one of the equivalents) prevents that stress from developing into a chronic, pathological condition.

Check everything out with your doctor. Show the links and references. If your readings aren’t in a critical range and your doctor will agree to work with you, try this stuff before going on meds.

Let me know how it goes.

If you have any more input on the blood pressure question, share your thoughts down below. If I think there’s enough new information out there, maybe I’ll do a dedicated post on the subject.

In June 2016, we published a blog about a phishing campaign targeting the Apple IDs and passwords of Chinese Apple users that emerged in the first quarter of 2016 (referred to as the “Zycode” phishing campaign). At FireEye Labs we have an automated system designed to proactively detect newly registered malicious domains and this system had observed some phishing domains that were designed to appear as legitimate Apple domains. Most of the domains reported by this system were suspended in June 2016, which resulted in a loss of momentum for the Zycode phishing campaign. Throughout the second quarter of 2016, the Zycode phishing campaign was in hibernation.

We recently observed a resurgence of the same phishing campaign when our systems detected roughly 90 phony Apple-like domains that were registered from July 2016 to September 2016. Once again, Chinese Apple users are being targeted for their Apple IDs and passwords using the same content reported on in our earlier blog. The majority of these domains are registered in the .com TLD by email accounts from qq[.]com, and the IPs of these domains point to mainland China, as seen in Figure 1.

What has not Changed?

The attackers have not changed the content of the phishing sites. The obfuscated JavaScript used in the earlier version is once again being used here in this campaign. We have provided the details of JavaScript and screenshots of interaction with the website in our earlier blog.
What has Changed?

Apparently the domains and email addresses used in previous version of the campaign were effectively taken down. Now the attackers have moved to a new malicious infrastructure; new domains, IPs and email addresses are being used for this campaign. The new domain names for the campaign are listed in Table 1, while their IPs and registrant emails are reported in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.

Me and them. Him, her and I. Myself, she and he. Us and him. Them and me.

Here we are. Two girls, one boy.

I’m sitting here at my desk in Northport, Michigan. Seven inches of winsome snow lay on my deck, and they accumulate quicker than I can sort out what my next sentence will be. Luke, the man I agreed to marry, sits opposite me and researches the point at which icebergs shouldn’t be a concern in crossing the North Atlantic Great Circle Route. I’ve had my fear on boats; adding icebergs to the list doesn’t appear to be deterring my hunger to cross oceans.

It’s been just over two years since Katie Smith and I completed America’s Great Loop aboard S/V Louise. I’ve spent my adulthood making abrupt life changes in two year stints. Whether it was where I was living, what I was studying, who I was dating, or where I was adventuring – in reaching two years, some kind of fervent curiosity always led me elsewhere. Every time. By no means has this been a conscious countdown…it’s this uncontrollable enthusiasm to do, to see, to be, more than whatever I was, whatever I am.  I’ve been back home in Michigan now for… just over two years.

Staying put has always been my most difficult task. If you were to query my  multiple employers they certainly wouldn’t categorize my actions as “staying put”. However from my perspective these past two years have been my safest. My most grounded. My most sensible. But here I am again uncontrollably enthused about not just one, but two of my finest decisions. The first one joyously shattering my two year stints, and the second one holding me right to schedule.

    I said yes to forever. I do not understand what forever means. I don’t think many of us do. But I have discovered who I want to try and understand that with. Who I want to work for that with. Who will freak out every two years with me, dropping everything, most likely to attempt something for which we are completely unqualified.
    So what now?  Our first test is an obvious one: to plan a sailing trip instead of a  wedding. We will sail double handed from my country to his. America to England. It only seems practical for us to sign up for the first “forever” test.

As the list begins of how we can possibl pull this off by spring, I have ransacked Luke’s notes with full intentions of relaying them to the world without his permission. So here they are… Luke’s unedited notes followed by my italicized assessment of course.
CREW

Who’s boss? Well that’s obvious – who is legally responsible? You’d think that’s “the man’s job” but technically the boat is Jess’s and her sister’s inheritance. So she is the captain. This is correct, Smart man. I could be considered a co-skipper.
JESSIE

6000 nm “America’s Great Loop” with another sea-bird called Katie, aboard a 27 foot Cal called ‘Louise’. Made famous by their mildly entertaining blog, articles in Cruising Outpost and on Sailing Anarchy. Two landlubbers on a learn or die mission to sail the inland waterways and Eastern seaboard of the United States of America. Including Bahamas and Canada. They made it, and came home with two years  of quality live-aboard experience. 60% coastal cruiser, 40% adventurer, 0% racer.
LUKE

Sailing everything and everywhere since 1995. 60% Racer, 40% adventurer 0% cruiser. Sailed an 18 ft catamaran double- handed 2000 nm around Great Britain because he was bored of sailing up and down the coast. Humbly not mentioning he holds a speed record for sailing  around Britain. http://www.yachtsandyachting.com/news/21288 Later sailed a 1937 wooden 15 sqm 1700 nm from the UK to Sweden for fun. Enjoys difficult situations. Likes to keep the spinnaker up too long. Thrives on danger. Has the oddest sense of humor.

DESIREÉ

1962 Pearson Invicta 37′ ketch designed by Bill Trip Jr. Yawl. Owned by Jessica’s father Jim Wizard ( his pride and joy for decades ). Old fashion shallow draft long keeler with centerboard designed for CCA rules. I don’t know what CCA means. Won the 1964 Newport to Bermuda race. Heavily built. First GRP boat to win this prestigious race. I don’t know what GRP means either…racing stuff.  There are 20 of these hulls in existence. It has made 4 Atlantic crossings in it’s time. Our hull, No. 8, has not seen the salt water since 1975-ish. It is in pristine condition and it will be expected of me to keep it this way. AH.

MISSION

Recently engaged couple attempts their first ocean crossing of the North Atlantic, sailing the great circle route double handed across the Atlantic is considered tough, very tough. It’s a long way north, its cold, its wet, and its windy. The dangers are everywhere, Atlantic storms, icebergs, huge seas, container ships, and potential Hurricanes. Sleep deprivation from being on watch becomes debilitating, even crippling as the days pass. Tempers will fray. Will this transatlantic leave their happy engagement in pieces or will they overcome the odds and become crew mates for ever. Dun dun dun.

pilot-chartAnd there you have it. We are both making light of this situation when it is in reality quite heavy. Poking fun at a serious quest is really the only way I know how to manage the highly overwhelming preparation.  Luke and I are taking on this responsibility seriously and have a full understanding of the threats it poses, the impact it will have on our families, and on our relationship. This colossal trial will test many things aside from young love. And for some unknown reason I have my head wrapped tightly around this possibility, just as the average 27-year-old would have around her wedding. What’s wrong with me? I am consumed. I am hyper. Keen – as Luke would say.

We are not being funded in any way and are not trying to be funded. Expenses are coming from what I have been able to save over the last several years and from what Luke will be contributing from his salary as the own label manager for Hyde Sails. We are blessed to have a solid, ocean worthy boat to borrow and if it weren’t for that we would be a long way from the ability to pull this off on such short notice. Narrowing down the list of prep-work and separating wants from needs has be tricky. Here is what we are left with :

    EPIRB
    SELF STEERING WIND-VANE
    AIS TRANSPONDER / RECIEVER FOR VHF
    JORDAN SERIES DROGUE (or something similar)
    NORTH ATLANTIC CHARTS / ST LAW. SEAWAY CHARTS & BOOKS
    SATALITE PHONE / IRIDIUM GO
    LIFE JACKETS
    FIRST AID
    CANADIAN CURTESY FLAG

If you have any of this stuff laying around, know someone who might, or if you have good contacts for any of these items please email me. If you have something else laying around you firmly believe is a need not a want / are interested in selling, email me. We would like to keep things simple as possible, bringing only the items that may help save our lives if and when we find ourselves in a sticky situation.

I welcome advice, direction, and any kind of feedback as we spend the next few months running around with our heads cut off. ANYTHING HELPS. I will be blogging about the process as well as writing articles for Cruising Outpost & Sailing Mag.

WOOOOOO !!!! ! ! ! ! !   !   !    !     !       !        !          !            !              !

Thank you for finding yourselves at this “mildly entertaining” blog once again. I promise to keep the content provided honest, authentic, and as relatble as possible. I understand these kind of voyages can be difficult to wrap our minds around. Those of you who make it to the end of these posts are those who keep me motivated. XO.

This is a conversation. Katie was on the bow. I was in the cockpit. We had not seen each other in quite sometime so we didn’t waste time with small talk and preferred to catch up on what was important.  After a few rounds blurting the-first-word-that-pops-into-your-head, I remembered what it was like to be on a boat with Katie Ariel Smith. Hysterical.

It had been 23 months since she and I had been on a boat together but one would have assumed no time had passed. The majority of our time sailing “The Great Loop”  was not all rainbows and butterflies as I tried to convey that through my previous word vomit. Photography and writing can be a bit contradictory as my images may have provided a delightful insight of everyday beauty while my writing typically depicted some kind of disaster. But this most recent trip was different. I’ve just spent a week on the Wizard’s (dad’s) sailboat with Katie and her puppy “Duppy” (No, captain Reggie has not been replaced. Duppy the Super Puppy is just easier to travel with these days). I unfortunately don’t have a story for you what-so-ever, simply some photos worthy of sharing. It was freaking perfect. It actually was rainbows and butterflies. I was sweating chocolate, she was shitting glitter and Duppy was barking Adele. Literally nothing went wrong. (Except for that morning we pulled up the anchor and were drifting towards rocks and I went to steer us towards deeper water, come to find out I had forgotten to put the steering wheel back on after taking it off the night before). Aside from that I am still baffled at the ease of our delivery and can’t shake the thought that I was undeserving of such a sunshiny week. I kept waiting for something to blow up.

The plan was brilliant. Katie and I to sail Desireé to a tiny town called DeTour Village on the eastern tip of Michigan’s UP … where we would switch crew with the Wizard and his Wizardess girlfriend so they could explore Lake Huron’s North Channel, his favorite waters to sail. A good family friend and his kids were to delivery Desireé back to our homeport, giving us each one week to cruise around on this dreamy yawl.


The Invicta was the first fiberglass hull to win the Rhode Island to Bermuda race in 1964.  There are only 21 of these hulls ever built. My sister and I grew up as leisurely and obnoxious passengers on hull no. 8. Desireé was purchased by the Wizard in his early 20’s after his first attempt to sail America’s Great Loop on a Coronado 23 when he called it quits after reaching the Bahamas. Took him years to pay Desireé  off as a diesel mechanic before he and his best bud “Hawk” took off down the Mississippi in 1975 for his second attempt on Desireé , which was a success. The rest of his cruising years were spent exploring the Great Lakes with friends, family, my Mother, and eventually my Sister and me. Over 20,000 miles logged, this boat is a brick shithouse.

Now at 27 years old the Wizard trusted me of all humans to sail his first born child around the bi-polar Great Lakes. Mind-boggling, I know. I was fairly confident Katie and I would have no problem delivering Desireé from A to B. Felt similar to when she and I took off on Louise. We had never anchored, only docked a hand full of times and sailed the boat twice. My experience on Desireé paralleled my experience on Louise. This time we were just tacking on another 10 feet and 20 thousand pounds and hoping to sort it out along the way.

The differences in helming this yawl were endless but there were two particularly note worthy… the first one being… everything worked. Every button pressed did as it was told. Anything that spun, spun freely the right direction. Gauges operated in their proper zones. The plumbing worked. The stove worked. The water-pump worked. The auto-pilot worked. Battery life was abundant. The Engine turned over smooth as cracking a Budweiser. Gadgets and gizmos galore that we could actually rely on. That alone… was like a 5 star hotel.  For two gals mentally prepared for all possible malfunctions, we lived like queens for one week.

Planning a boat trip can be a hassle, especially when it comes to reserving a mooring or a slip at a faraway marina destination. Unless, that is, you have the Dockwa app.

Dockwa is a simple smartphone app that lets boaters quickly and easily reserve a spot with just a click. The interface is straightforward and clean, with large beautiful images of destinations you may want to visit. Whether you’re enjoying Martha’s Vineyard or planning a jaunt to Puerto Rico, Dockwa can help.

“We like to think that boaters are definitely explorers,” said Adrian Mott, VP of Marketing for Dockwa.

It’s that spirit of exploration that Dockwa taps into. Dockwa’s users are “the boater that likes to cruise on the weekend and go to a port that isn’t their home port. That tends to be people who are more willing to explore, a little bit more of a seasoned boater, someone who knows how to navigate,” Mott explained.

You can find marinas near your current location; search by date, dockage, services, and amenities; message marinas; and pay for a reservation, right from your iPhone or Android devices.
Dockwa mobile app
The Dockwa app is polished and easy to use.

Best of all, the app is free to boaters.

The app was created in 2014 in Newport, Rhode Island, and has since seen massive growth, expanding to marinas along the Eastern seaboard and even into the Caribbean. Close to 250 marinas are now members, and the company is seeking to expand to the Great Lakes and West Coast, according to posts on their Facebook page.

Boaters can scroll through a list of marinas, either while still on land and planning the next getaway or on the water, when they’re looking for the nearest pit stop. Each listing includes an address, dock or mooring prices, and contact information, as well as a list of amenities with simple, easy-to-understand icons so you’ll know what to expect on arrival.

Booking is also a snap: Just request a reservation by inputting the type and length of your boat, the dates of your trip, and some basic contact information for the marina.

The 500,000 members of BoatUS have an extra incentive: discounted rates at select marinas, thanks to a partnership with Dockwa. “Every BoatUS marina has their own discount for BoatUS members,” Mott said. “For example, some offer 20 to 50 percent off transient dockage. Others offer 10 to 20 cents off every gallon of fuel. We made it easy with our relationship with BoatUS to allow them to add their BoatUS ID card into each reservation.”

And if you do have a problem, Dockwa offers 24/7 support to get you sailing.
The company focused on making the experience as easy as possible for both the marina and the individual boater. “After a boater gets a feel for the app and how easy it is, they keep coming back,” Mott said.

As a freelance journalist, I often choose the subjects I write about. Sometimes, though, editors come to me with ideas. Which means I occasionally end up writing bizarre stories on topics I never would have considered otherwise. Last fall, I was contacted by an editor at a “creative agency” in London. One of their clients was a Swedish manufacturer of ski helmets, for whom they had produced three issues–one per year–of a strange but really well-executed little magazine. The most recent issue had been about “the way in which natural and manmade shapes and spaces impact on our lives,” whatever that means.

The next edition, the editor said, would be about “power.” Would I like to write an essay about power in nature? The story should include an exploration of “energy, forces and phenomenons,” should “explore the physics behind power,” and would ideally conclude with a discussion of how we can harness natural energy as a sustainable resource. Part of me was like, “Um, no way.” But part of me was intrigued; I liked the idea of writing something that was entirely free from the “why are we writing about this now?” dictum that governs most of my journalism work. And, you know, it came with a paycheck. So why not, right?

I have no idea what happened to the magazine. As far as I know, it never was published. The editor no longer replies to my email, after I made a fuss about getting said paycheck sometime this century. (I did ultimately get paid. But it wasn’t exactly hassle-free.) But since I bothered to write the damn thing, I thought I would let it see the light of day. Possibly it sucks beyond compare. Possibly there’s a germ of something interesting in it. Who knows. It’s wholly unedited, potentially unreadable, but may at the very least serve as a window onto the weird career I continue to cling to, despite the piles of evidence that you have to be slightly nuts to keep plugging away at it.

Here’s the essay.

Open your window in a city, and you can see, hear, and smell the energy. Not the buzz of ambition and social interactions — though there’s that too, of course. But the literal energy: the stuff that’s running the cars and lights and laptops and subways. Take a mental step backward, and you can start to envision the energy embodied within the city, in our homes, offices, possessions. Energy was used to mine raw materials (steel for high-rises, copper for wires, lithium for batteries, platinum for the chemical reactions that produce clothing, medicine, tires), to ship them, to assemble them into components of urban life. The energy in our built environments is everywhere; it’s tangible.

Now venture out into nature — to a field, a forest, a seashore. There, the energy might not be as immediately apparent. We might sense nature’s power — in the waves, the wind, the trees that tower above. But the exact presence of energy is somewhat hidden. It’s not like a high-def TV, where our basic modern knowledge tells us that electricity — energy from a coal-fired power plant, say — is making the system run.

There’s no more ubiquitous force in nature, though, than energy. Energy grows the forest and brews the thunderstorm and holds the hawks aloft and propels the throng of wildebeests across the savannah. Energy rules the earthworm and the earthquake, the snowflake and the avalanche, the northern white rhinoceros and the northern lights. We tend to think of the natural world as a big mess of biology. But underpinning it all, the governing force is physics.

“Whenever anything is happening,” wrote E.C. Pielou, an ecologist who studied the physics of nature, “energy is being transferred from one piece of matter to another.” We are all, she wrote, “surrounded all the time by energy transfers.”

Take another look around you. The leaves on the trees are doing chemistry, combining the most basic of ingredients — sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water — in a recipe that yields sugar (for themselves) and oxygen (for people and other oxygen-breathing types). Everything that eats plants — microbes, bugs, birds, mammals — uses those sugars as its own source of energy. Seen this way, that fallen leaf you just stepped on isn’t just nature’s cast-off; it’s the true embodiment of power in the world.

Energy is agnostic about its own outcome. It can just as easily destroy — consuming landscapes in fire, transforming the placid sea into city-submerging waves, converting a virile elk to a heap of bones at the feet of a mountain lion.

Energy is so basic to our world that at the very beginning, the Big Bang, our speck of a universe consisted of nothing else. Fifteen billion years later, we think of our world as consisting largely of things — what physicists would call “matter,” everything from rocks to clouds to ships to dogs to trousers. But as Pielou explains, in a book called “The Energy of Nature,” none of that matter does anything at all without energy. “The salient point about events,” she wrote — and here an “event” can mean anything: a bird calling for a mate, a baby crying, a hailstone hitting your car — “is that without energy they couldn’t happen.”

Massive concepts can be surprisingly tough to grasp. In that way, energy is a bit like God: You get it, but also you can’t comprehend it at all. What exactly is energy, anyway? It’s one of those infuriating terms that are defined by other vague terms — whose definitions just refer back to energy. At a basic level, energy is the capacity to perform work. Work, in physics, is a measurement of force — a measurement that involves the transfer of energy. To make it even more confusing, “power,” which is often used interchangeably with “energy,” is actually a measure of rate: the rate at which energy is moved around.

If our whole world is a spinning ball of moving energy, why do we have an energy crisis? Can’t we simply harness it in smarter ways? The trouble is, we’re fussy. We don’t just want energy. We want power on demand—immediate access to it in particular forms, in particular amounts. Nature doesn’t offer it that way. That’s part of the problem with trying to replace energy from fossil fuels with energy from wind. The wind doesn’t blow all the time, whereas humans can burn coal whenever we need to. Same with the sun, which doesn’t shine ’round the clock (or ever, it sometimes feels like, in London). In some ways, our energy problem is really an issue of storage. If we can just find the right way to store energy from renewable sources, so we have it when we need it, we’ll be set.

One promising new technology mimics photosynthesis with an artificial leaf that turns sunlight into energy that can be stored — just like in a plant. The beauty of this idea stems from its attempt to mimic nature rather than try to outdo it. The device uses sunlight to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen; the hydrogen powers a fuel cell.

Other emerging forms of renewable energy also try to operate within nature’s codes: like wave power, which generates electricity from the energy in ocean waves. Or river turbines, which tap natural currents for energy. Unlike traditional hydropower, which captures water and then releases it, this new type of hydro harnesses a river’s constant flow.

The race for renewable sources of energy is far from over, and the winners may ultimately be those that mimic nature rather than subverting it. Because one thing is certain: we cannot change physics. We can’t overpower the energy of nature. It’s everywhere. Hurricanes will still whip up over the oceans; deep within those same seas, all sorts of critters are bartering energy; the water’s own energy controls the shape of coastlines with its force. Back on land, elephants’ lumbering footsteps reverberate miles away, sending messages in energy to each other, and to countless other creatures that respond to the vibrations with their own energy transfers — feeding, mating, decomposing. Energy runs the world. We just work here.

Last week, the Future of Life Institute (FLI) released an open letter calling for a ban on autonomous weapons. The institute defines these as systems that can “elect and engage targets without human intervention,” and proposes that, “Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has reached a point where the deployment of such systems is—practically if not legally—feasible within years, not decades...”

But the content of that letter is pretty irrelevant. It's a breezy, 437-word document that's more Facebook post than rallying cry. It's also the second such warning about the dangers of AI that FLI has made this year. In January, they issued an open letter about AI safety, referencing issues of privacy and workplace injury, as well as the existential threat of machines that might wipe out humankind. That document attracted widespread attention, in large part due to famous signatories like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking. Now, both have also signed the new letter.

But Musk and Hawking's involvement isn't of much note, either. They've gone on the record in the past with shrill and unsupported fears of AI, using the language and logic of science fiction rather than any research-based conclusions. Their bias is established, and despite their clear brilliance in other matters, the topic is outside of their professional and academic purview. Hawking studies high-energy physics, and most famously fretted over AI in an op-ed tied to the 2014 movie Transcendence. And Musk's many futuristic ventures don't yet include AI. Even the co-founders of Vicarious, the AI firm that Musk has personally invested in, have effectively debunked his claims that researchers are actually working to avoid an apocalyptic outbreak of runaway machine intelligence.

So what's important about FLI's letter, if not its content, or its most prominent signatories?

It's that virtually every major player in AI and robotics has endorsed it. The growing army of signatories signatories currently includes more than 50 Google engineers and researchers, many of who are from DeepMind, the AI firm that Google acquired last year for $400M. Also on the list are Yann LeCun, director of AI research for Facebook, and Yoshua Bengio, an AI researcher from the University of Montreal. They're pioneers in the field of deep learning, a subset of AI that's often associated with the potential to create truly human-like machine intelligence. When I interviewed them for a story about the dangers of AI fear-mongering, they viewed such handwringing as largely irrelevant, and detrimental to the field. In Bengio's case, he even worried about researchers being targeted by people tricked into seeing AI as an apocalyptic threat. And yet, the very people who are concerned about the increasing backlash against anything robotic are on board with the idea of banning autonomous weapons.
What we're seeing is the beginning of an inevitability.

What we're seeing is the beginning of an inevitability. The open letter comes on the heels of the second United Nations conference on the subject of banning lethal autonomous weapon systems, or LAWS (an unfortunate acronym, in the context of a ban). Those meetings have yet to produce a binding agreement or proposal, and were presented as an ongoing discussion, rather than a prelude to political. But the final line of FLI's letter is more direct. “Starting a military AI arms race is a bad idea, and should be prevented by a ban on offensive autonomous weapons beyond meaningful human control.”

Human rights groups want these systems banned. A huge number of AI researchers and roboticists do, too. That consensus is only going to get bigger as autonomous killing machines become more feasible, or actually find their way onto the battlefield. This is a doomed technology.

The questions that remain, however, are not trivial, or obvious: What exactly are we banning, and when?

* * *

The central goal of the anti-autonomous weapons movement can be summed up in a single term: meaningful human control.

You can read a lot into those three words, including some misconceptions. There are fringe elements within their ranks, but most critics of LAWS aren't afraid of a Terminator-style robot uprising. The desire to control armed machines is about preserving the human decision to kill. There are philosophical reasons for not allowing robots to determine when to use lethal force—that it should be a hard decision, for example, with an emotional cost—as well as more practical concerns. FLI's letter warns about the risk of proliferation, that with their eventual low cost and inherent ease of use, “autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow.” If a swarm of disposable bomb-carrying robots can be fielded by anyone, then what prevents their use by everyone?

Heather Roff, a political scientist and visiting professor at the University of Denver, also worries about LAWS creating a new class of blameless atrocity, where the killing of bystanders or surrendering hostiles can be chalked up to a glitch. “Suddenly everything becomes an accident,” says Roff. “There is no more definition of war crime, because there's no intention.” The line between the misuse of autonomous force and a genuine malfunction already seems hopelessly blurred, even before LAWS have reached the battlefield.

In 2013, a UK-based nonprofit called Article 26 coined the term “meaningful human control,” in an attempt to pin down what critics of autonomous weapons are actually seeking. But as effective as the term has been in unifying anti-LAWS sentiment, there's no real sense of what it means. “It gives us a really useful analytical framework,” says Hoff. “In the past year, meaningful human control was cited very often, in papers and presentations. Right now, the question is, Yeah, we all like the way it sounds, but what does it mean?”

So Roff and Article 26 are collaborating on a research project to explore the specific parameters of meaningful human control. That includes giving the anti-LAWS community a more concrete sense of what it's against, to help codify what it's proposing. For the past six months, Roff has been building a database of semi-automated killers, starting with systems from the five nations that export and import the most weapons. “Everybody discusses artificial intelligence and autonomous weapons and semi autonomous weapons,” says Roff, “but there seems to be a lacuna of what that means, and what we're talking about.”

The Phalanx CIWS (close-in weapon system) can automatically target and fire at incoming missiles.

What's the difference in autonomy between, for example, a Phalanx system on a naval vessel, that can be set to scan the horizon for incoming missiles and fire on targets at will, and the Harab, a drone that can loiter over an area, and then nosedive into the first radar emitter it detects (the assumption is that it's detonating over a Stinger or similar surface-to-air missile launcher)? And as new systems show up, what criteria will we use to determine which might full under a potential ban?

On July 1, Roff and Article 26 were approved for a grant of $104,000 from FLI, to fund a year of research into autonomous weapon systems. The money was part of a $10M donation from Elon Musk, to be distributed among proposals for AI safety-related projects. Though Roff is still looking for funding for another year (the proposal mapped out two years of research), she can finally pay her graduate students for their participation, and devote more time to the question of what actually constitutes autonomy in weapons, and meaningful control.

Here's an example of why this kind of basic research is relevant. What if, to avoid any ugly outcomes involving the killing of humans, a nation developed drones that were strictly anti-materiel, meaning they could only attack other drones. That would seem to counter to concerns that groups like Islamic State wouldn't be constrained by a LAWS ban. A swarm of drone-hunters would be the robotic equivalent of a missile defense system, like those ship-based Phalanx systems. Problem solved, right?

But what happens when a counter-drone swarm discovers enemy bots within a crowd of civilians? If, like the Phalanx, the drones are designed to faster than a human can respond—who could have to cue up and approve 1000 different targets in a matter of moments—they might take action immediately, and descend and self-destruct in the immediate vicinity of civilians. Authorities could express their regret at what amounts to collateral damage, and possibly blame the other side for finding a loophole on their autonomous rules of engagement. Now repeat that event, in countless permutations throughout various conflicts around the world. And that's not to mention the potential for LAWS to be used in covert actions, with governments denying their involvement in an assassination. “All of a sudden the world looks a little more bleak,” says Roff. “Artificial intelligence starts to be really scary.”

* * *

In the past, I've argued that the researchers and human rights groups that are advocating a ban on LAWS were wasting time and resources. No one in the military wants systems that are a line of bad code away from unleashing friendly fire on their personnel.

It's embarrassing how wrong I was.

The going assumption in the anti-LAWS community is that, when you read between the lines of Pentagon-sourced material, such as DARPA's requests for proposals or the U.S. Navy's projections of where warfare is headed, autonomous weapons are coming. I'm not entirely convinced. There's a connect-the-dots quality to some of this rhetoric, that's uncomfortably close to conspiracy theory. The internet has brought much-needed scrutiny of the defense industry's every move, and my view was that, until a nation attempts to develop, why bother debating one out of an infinite number of applications for robotics? The field is already saddled with outlandish fears. Rampaging killbots are yet another sci-fi-inspired fever dream.

But I wasn't grasping the complexities of this issue, or the growing momentum among researchers who study robotics. Roff's work is just one of many examples of attempts to apply data and scientific rigor to what originated as an impassioned, but somewhat vague political argument.

I'm most embarrassed, however, at missing an obvious point: There's no harm in banning autonomous weapons. With researchers like Roff actively mapping out the parameters for such regulations, it's clear that a ban on LAWS wouldn't be a blanket restriction on other kinds of autonomous robots. And an international ban would give nations political options for dealing with governments who deploy them anyway.
The only harm is in waiting for autonomous weapons to start killing.

The only harm is in waiting for autonomous weapons to start killing. What if we could have banned chemical weapons before the first clouds rolled over soldiers, killing between 30,000 and 90,000 of them outright in WWI (estimates vary widely), and causing an unknown number of lethal cancers in others? And what if the public had known about nuclear weapons during their development in the 1940s? Cities like Hiroshima and Nagasaki might still have been targeted, and fire-bombed with conventional weapons. A-bomb apologists have argued that more Allied lives might have lost, if Japan hadn't been stunned in surrender by a horrifying new technology, capable of leveling entire cities with a single bomb. Still, is there any doubt that, when faced with the prospect of the global proliferation of radioactive doomsday weapons, the world would have at least considered banning their creation?

In hindsight, it seems inevitable that chemical and nuclear weapons would be fully or at least partially banned. Those actions came too late for thousands of victims. Autonomous weapons might never be considered as inhumane or as politically destabilizing, but the potential for increased suffering and chaos is hardly worth the benefits of automating lethality, whether by design or accident. We have a unique opportunity to preempt some amount of tragedy before it occurs, and before there's a chance for runaway proliferation.

It's a case I can't even muster the full effort to make, because it so obviously makes itself. But for this inevitable ban to be effective, researchers like Roff have their work cut out for them. The academic basis of any such regulations has to be data-driven and respectful of human dignity, without being merely pacifist. “I'm a just war theorist, so implicitly that means that sometimes I think war is okay,” says Roff. “ It's about thinking this issue through. Because technology is not value-neutral. It is value loaded.”

I contacted my friend and speaker coach Dr. Nick Morgan. “Hey Nick, I have a speaker dilemma and I could use your input!” I had a speaking engagement booked at Tony Robbins Business Mastery in Palm Beach a few days later and I was injured. I wanted Nick’s advice for how I should manage my obvious disability while presenting to the nearly 2,000 people in the best way possible.

Alert readers may have read about my surgery to remove a large non-cancerous tumor on my ankle. I wrote a story about my journey: My Personal Experiences with the Medical Marijuana Business and the Opioid Epidemic and posted it on Medium. While I am healing on schedule, I’d be in a “boot” and possibly using crutches during my talk and was concerned about how to handle it.

I’ve been working with Nick for a decade and his advice is essential for my growth as a professional speaker at conferences and events. It’s been really important for me to have a coach I can go to on a regular basis when I need work on some aspect of my speaking skills.
What do you do when 'break a leg" actually happens?

“Nick, help! How should I handle the obvious fact that I am on crutches? I’m worried that it will physically throw off my game. And people will clearly see that I’ve got an injury. What advice can you give me about the situation?”

My wife Yukari Watanabe Scott suggested that I exaggerate the fact that I am on crutches rather than try to hide it. She said to play it up. I thought she was right, but I was worried about people thinking that I was looking for sympathy.

In particular, I wanted Nick’s advice on when should I mention the crutches and boot the first time in the talk and how.

I’ll let Nick take it from here.

Nick Morgan.jpgWhen David called, my first thought was the old theatre adage: “The show must go on.” David makes his living from public speaking, and that means always being a professional. As a professional, as David knows, you show up unless you can’t, and “can’t” in this sentence only means “dead.”

So taking a few weeks’ recovery in the Caribbean was not an option, nice as that sounded. David had to speak.

The next question was, how does he handle the boot (and crutches)? It’s a classic elephant-in-the-room issue, because it’s visible. If David didn’t talk about it, the audience would be distracted for the entire speech, wondering what the problem was.

So he has to talk about it.

But – and here’s the key – he doesn’t have to make it the main event. His talk was not about recent medical advances, or the pros and cons of playing through the pain. Nor was his talk an autobiography. David was talking about marketing, and so the boot/crutches needed to be subordinated to the main purpose of the talk.

That meant that he didn’t want to make the main frame of the talk about the boot. Rather, he wanted to bring it up after the initial opening story and frame, and get to the boot about ten minutes in, give or take.

In that way, he could start the talk on message, frame the purpose of the speech for the audience in the right way, and then, once that was accomplished, deal with the boot. At that point, if there was a way to make the boot relevant to the point of the overall talk, he could spend longer on it. If it was just an aside, then he’d need to move faster, so that the overall flow of the talk was maintained.

So that was my advice. The show must go on, so you have to talk about it. But don’t make it the main event.

How did it go, David?
Speak like you always do. But different.

The conversations with Nick were essential for me to manage the fact that this would be a different presentation than I was used to. I still wanted to be high energy (well as much energy as one can put into a more than two hour speech with a boot on). I was comfortable in the knowledge that I could still perform as long as I was clear in my mind how to proceed.

In the week leading up to the event, I planned to mention my injury onstage 3 times and I worked those mentions into my talk. The first time, as Nick suggested, I planned for about 10 minutes into the talk, just after the opening story and framing of my presentation. I also planned a second mention about 30 minutes in and a final time near the end of the talk.

On the day of my presentation, I used a meal break to spend more than an hour exploring the stage, practicing with my crutches and the clicker at the same time (difficult!), and conferring with the production staff including audio, the video camera operators, and production manger, so we’d all be in synch on my plans.

I’m glad I did, because when I first mentioned my injury, the camera operators knew to zoom in on my boot at that point so the audience could clearly see.

At 30 minutes in, I brought up my surgery again, making a marketing lesson out of it when I mentioned the story I wrote about the experience speaking with my surgeon. I showed the story I wrote on Medium and shared how to use everyday experiences as ideas for content that you can create for marketing purposes.

On stage, while my ankle hurt quite a bit, I had mentally prepared. Once adrenaline and the audience’s kind support kicked in I put the pain in the back of my mind. Because I was prepared, I knew exactly when I would mention the surgery and how. Once I got going, I found that I only needed to use the crutches as a prop a few times.

Near the end of the talk, I explained that my injury taught me the life lesson that when you experience a setback, you have to face up to it, plan around it, and – if you want to fire on all cylinders – embrace it. As Tony Robbins says: “It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped.”

I’m glad that I decided to work with Nick and he helped me to weave my injury into my talk.

No excuses.

Speaking of Nick and his advice, he is running his Powerful Public Speaking workshop on March 31, 2017 in Boston. I attended several years ago and it is highly recommended.

David, this is amazing advice and Nick gives great counsel. I recall near the beginning of my career jumping off stage at the Venetian in Las Vegas into the darkness during sound check, and thinking the floor was right there like any other riser. The stage was about 10 feet high. I crashed down and both shoes burst off my feet. I couldn't walk, felt like I'd shattered both heels. Doors opened a few minutes later with a full house. I crawled backstage and that is when I realized truly the show always goes on. I limped out on stage and just made it a part of the act, that "I only do this presentation on my toes" as I shuffled about and did the full 90 minute event. Love that you made this work for you, such a great example I will share with those I teach about stage craft. Continued success.

It was fantastic to meet you, and Jonathan and I are enjoying going through your New Marketing Mastery lessons! Speaking from experience as a person who has had a difficult time doing so in the past, it is tough to show vulnerability. You did so beautifully, and completely won the 2017 Business Master Florida crowd over! It's taken me many years to learn that being vulnerable is truly being strong. I look forward to crossing paths again in the future!

    Everyone who lives in a watershed influences its natural resources – soil, water, air, plants and animals – and each other. This influence can extend both upstream and downstream from a land use. For this reason, good stewardship by everyone living, working and recreating in a watershed is important to ensure good watershed conditions.

     
    Why a Watershed Approach?



    A watershed approach is the most effective framework to address today's water resource challenges. Watersheds supply drinking water, provide recreation and respite, and sustain life. More than $450 billion in food and fiber, manufactured goods, and tourism depends on clean water and healthy watersheds.

    A Watershed Approach:

        Is geographically defined and includes all water quality stressors

        Involves all stakeholders, including public (federal, state, local) and private sector

        Is community based

        Includes a coordinating framework

        Strategically addresses priority water resource goals (e.g. water quality, habitat), based on sound science, aided by strategic watershed plans and uses adaptive management
        Everyone lives in a watershed. Do you know which watershed you live in? Provided below is a map of the Middle Eel River Watershed and its subwatersheds. If you live in the Middle Eel River Watershed - Can you find the watershed you live in?

    What can you do to help improve water quality?

    Agriculture

        Manage animal waste to minimize contamination of surface water and ground water.
        Protect drinking water by minimizing fertilizer use and by learning how to prevent pest problems. When pesticides are used, minimize detrimental impacts by using least toxic pesticides and by following all label directions.

        Reduce soil erosion by using conservation practices and other applicable best management practices.

        Use planned grazing systems on pasture and rangeland.

        Dispose of pesticides, containers and tank rinsate in an approved manner.

    Urban Stormwater Runoff

        Keep litter, pet wastes, leaves and debris out of street gutters and storm drains—these outlets drain directly to lake, streams, rivers and wetlands.

        Apply lawn and garden chemicals sparingly and according to directions.

        Dispose of used oil, antifreeze, paints and other household chemicals properly—not in storm sewers or drains. If your community does not already have a program for collecting household hazardous wastes, ask your local government to establish one.

        Clean up spilled brake fluid, oil, grease and antifreeze. Do not hose them into the street where they can eventually reach local streams and lakes.

        Control soil erosion on your property by planting ground cover and stabilizing erosion-prone areas.

        Encourage local government officials to develop construction erosion and sediment control ordinances in your community.

        Have your septic system inspected and pumped, at a minimum every three to five years, so that it operates properly.

        Purchase household detergents and cleaners that are low in phosphorous to reduce the amount of nutrients discharged into our lakes, streams and coastal waters.

    Forestry

        Use proper logging and erosion control practices on your forest lands by ensuring proper construction, maintenance and closure of logging roads and skid trails.

        Report questionable logging practices to state and federal forestry and state water quality agencies.  

        Women in European Ultimate is a new monthly series of interviews with standout female players, coaches and administrators from across our continent who inspire those around them. We’re hoping to shed light on how these athletes have got to where they are, what drives them and what they have planned for the future. We will discuss what they want from our sport and what they give to our sport. In doing so, we hope to show how hard work, commitment, generosity and positivity can build communities, teams, friendships and more. Interview by Mark “Marko”  Earley.



        Hello Nici! How are you?

        Fantastic 🙂

        You are currently based in Hamburg. What is the local Ultimate scene like? And, what role have you taken on with the local team?

        I actually started playing Ultimate in Hamburg when I was 14, so this lot basically raised me (I obviously blame all my character flaws on certain hard-fishy influences). When I came back last year, my previous women’s team had dissolved… So me and Margit Müller decided to reinstate the Hamburg Seagulls and started running women’s practices again. In the beginning we had like 6 girls who would show up regularly, by the end of the season we had over 20 every single practice. It was amazing to see all the potential and motivation build into a really great team throughout the season. I absolutely love coaching them and I am very excited to see the Seagulls further develop next season.

         What are your goals for the team for next season? And for you as a player?

        We have a league system in Germany, so any new team has to first qualify for second league to even be able to compete at German nationals. We did, and we also won second league, so obviously the next goal is to attack first league this season. I think our biggest challenge this season will be to keep having such an integrative and open team culture, even though we will have to make cuts for each and every tournament – this year around we started with 35 girls at the first practice… For me as a player my main focus will be to become very fit until June – Beach Worlds with only 15 players is going to be quite a mission.

         You’ve played at the highest level here in Europe with Iceni and last two seasons made the trip to the US to play with Showdown, the Texan team, at Pro Flight and US Nationals. How do the elite players on each continent stack up against one another?

        It is hard for me to compare Iceni with Showdown, since I played a whole season with Iceni, while for Showdown I only played three tournaments. I think generally speaking, the top European players are just as skilled as the top American players; however, we have a lot fewer of them.

        NP3

        What were the main differences between the way the teams prepare and play in the States and what you’ve seen here in Europe?

        I feel overall, top American teams train more professionally with regards to almost everything: strategy, fitness, attitude, having a non-playing coach, and so forth. With regards to playing I find that American teams at the elite level are better at winning against tough opposition, while European teams at the elite level are not used to tough opposition. During my season with Iceni we didn’t really have any close games at all against other European teams and then we went to US Open at got a proper beating for the most part 😀 At that US Open we actually had a game against Showdown, which we lost by two points.

        US Nationals must be an incredible spectacle. What are your lasting memories from it?

        Well, I guess my most lasting memory from that first US Open was a broken foot. And I obviously broke it while doing something incredibly cool on the pitch- NOT. Ok I’ll admit I broke it after our last game in the spirit circle while jumping for a t-shirt… Got the t-shirt… Totally worth it.

        When and how did you first start playing with Iceni? Describe a standard week of training with Iceni.

        I moved to London for my master’s degree in 2014 and tried out for the team. This was the first time I had ever tried out for a club team… We had two great captains, Ange Wilkinson and Sonia Komenda, and I think they did a lot of things very well in terms of running the team. We had great team commitment and a lot of chemistry on and off the pitch. In fact a lot of how we run the seagulls now I learned from those two stars. A standard training week would involve 2-3 training sessions (Tuesday night, Saturday and sometimes Sunday), 2 gym sessions and one track session. Once a month we would have a fitness session with our strength and conditioning coach – Dave  Peterson (RBD Personal Training), teaching us the new program for the next month. It was a lot of practice. I think probably the most I have ever trained for Ultimate – it was amazing fun.

        What do you think has allowed Iceni to stay at the top of the sport for so long?

        I think Iceni is probably the European club team that trains the most – and also most professionally, at least that I know of. Also they have the luxury that London has a great player base to choose from. And finally they have a lot of practice at winning 🙂

        How does a club set up like that of Iceni’s compare with the national team set ups you’ve been a part of? Is there much of a difference?

        No not a lot. With Iceni we had a professional fitness coach, which I have not had on any national team that I’ve played on. Also as a club team you get to practice together a lot more, which is great. I feel Iceni was basically a national team, just better because you get to play together every week!

        NP2

         Having represented Germany in a number of different divisions and at different ages you have a unique experience of how national teams work. What, in your opinion, are the main ingredients needed for success when representing your country?

        A valid passport. Oh wait, no actually I found out you don’t need that 😀 Ok maybe a story for a different occasion… I think the main challenge for any national team is team chemistry, on and off the pitch. It is basically a long-distance and short-term relationship. So the first thing you need is a lot of commitment, and for that you need a great leader. I was fortunate enough to play under Yelena Gorlin as a coach last season, who was the embodiment of team commitment. She actually managed to have the team train together every 3 weeks, come rain, come shine, for over half a year! It was intense to say the least 😀 But we really came together as a team!

        Tell us about some of your standout memories playing for Germany.

        One of the most recent great memories was the close quarterfinal loss against Columbia. Such a hard fought game. Probably one of the most exciting games I have ever played in. Since it had rained a shit ton the previous day, the whole area was closed off to anyone not playing. But somehow the whole German mixed team squad had managed to sneak on one of the team buses going to the pitches. Since they weren’t allowed on the area where the pitches where, they stood quite far away behind a gate in the pouring rain. Another couple of Germany supporters suddenly appeared disguised as volunteers next to our pitch. All this just to cheer for us. When the game was over, I remember how all of them applauded us, it was quite moving.

        The other most memorable moment was losing in a Beach Worlds final in sudden death against the freaking Americans after a 6:2 lead. I think ever since that moment I have wanted to f*** win that game once in my life. In retrospect it was quite a motivator for the last couple of years for me personally, to keep pushing to become a better player and then some more… I hope I’ll get a second chance at that game. Maybe this season at Beach Worlds.

         Alongside all of this elite Ultimate you seem to make time for fun Ultimate too. What are your three favourite party tournaments, and why?

        Number one will have to go to windmill windup, if you play it as a fun tournament it is really fun! I love the festival vibe about it, all the little details. A close second place will go to Bubblepest. A fun indoor 3G artificial turf 7 on 7 tournament that takes place in January. Next to the amazing boat party in a truly mesmerizing city, the afternoon and morning pool schedule allows for some very extensive spa sessions. Also I recommend sleeping in the groove hostel, which is literally just above the 3 floor club, where the tournament party takes place, which means you get to party all night long… and will still make it into your bed. Number three on the list… Tough decision. I think I will go for Lei out. Not that I have ever been, but from what I have been told, I think it would probably be my third favourite tournament. In fact, if I could go back in time, it would have been Paganello. You know back in the day when it was still cool…

        Away from Ultimate, do you play any other sports? If you weren’t so focused on Ultimate which sport would you devote yourself to?

        In the off season/pre-season I like to go bouldering. I also love hiking and all the other outdoor sports. However, if I was to devote myself to a different sport it would probably be beach volleyball. I absolutely love all beach sports, since they combine some of the best things in life: summer, sun, beach ocean, sport… Also I prefer team sport over individual sport in the long run. And, it has one very big advantage over Ultimate – it’s actually in the Olympics.

         Do you think your experiences in other sports have helped with your Ultimate career or visa versa?

        My first competitive sport was volleyball, which might have helped with the diving. I also used to be a gymnast, which I believe helps with all the sports. It just combines all the important elements in sport; strength, coordination, flexibility… Ok maybe not endurance. (Fun fact: Kyoko Hosokawa (German national team teammate) and I actually first met when we were like 12 doing gymnastics together. Which absolutely proves my point that gymnastics are great for all the sports. She was always better than I am – so you see, things never really change :-D)

        What do you do for a career? And, a question we love asking busy players, how do you find the time to make it all work?

        I work at the university. Currently I am doing my PhD researching long-term health in retired football players. I love it very much, but it is a lot of work. So how do I find the time, that is a very good question. I find it very tough to train this much while working full-time, to be honest. It was easier when I was a student. Basically you give up on all private live apart from frisbee during the season, and then make up for it in the off season. It’s a matter of priorities. At the moment, frisbee still is my priority so I am happy to devote this amount of time to it.

        Alongside your playing career you’ve been involved in running some coaching clinics too – in Portugal and in Russia. How did those opportunities come about? How do the two experiences compare?

        For both opportunities it was just through knowing people. In Russia they asked Rob Schumacher (Clapham, GB) and myself to do a clinic for the mixed national team. We got very badly drunk on Russian vodka the night before the first day of the clinic, and the organiser was quite worried that we wouldn’t show. But I am proud to say we did show and feedback apparently was good enough so they wanted us back for the next day 😀 We suffered a lot though. Doing the Russian clinic was a very cool experience. Our hosts were so welcoming, showed us around in Moscow and invited us for all the typically Russian activities. It was fun.

        In Portugal we did a beach clinic for everyone who could make it. So the level was a bit different, and we didn’t focus on team strategy so much, but more on individual skills. Also the clinic involved a lot of galao drinking on the beach, and less vodka, thank goodness. What I loved most about both clinics was meeting so many cool, interesting and welcoming Frisbee people from other countries.

        If a snake bites you in a remote Amazonian village like Pampa Hermosa, Peru, and the local doctor is out of the right anti-venom, it might be wise to prepare some goodbyes. The nearest resupply, in a town called Contamana, is up to six hours away by riverboat, and you might not last that long. But you might last 35 minutes, the travel time between Pampa Hermosa and Contamana as the drone flies.

        A single unmanned aerial vehicle or UAV could dart over the lush canopy with a vial of life saving anti-venom, and a nonprofit called WeRobotics is trying to make that a reality. Last September, the company, which aims to use technology for humanitarian purposes, started testing drones that might be able to deliver small emergency supplies, like anti-venom, on that Pampa Hermosa-Contamana run.

        If it works, a fleet of flying robots would substantially bolster public health capabilities in a region often with few roads or ready access to fast boats. "Delivering health care in the Peruvian Amazon basin is a major issue," says Dr. Willy Lescano, an epidemiologist at Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia. "And it's going to need creative approaches like this."

        But the initial testing, in September, which WeRobotics describes in a report released Monday, was off to a rocky start. WeRobotics had acquired a specialized cargo drone that can land and take off vertically, a useful ability in a region where large open spaces are rare. The large drone can carry a roughly 5 pound payload and range as far as 37 miles. It's an impressive robot.

        The only problem was the $40,000 rig wouldn't fly once WeRobotics set it up in Contamana. "It was incredibly depressing. We were like, holy cow, this is a complete disaster," says Patrick Meier, a cofounder of WeRobotics, which is funded mainly by grants and donations.

        The team had another drone with them, an old flier strapped together with duct tape and originally designed for mapping and aerial imagery work. "Our Peruvian flying labs team just happened to have this old, beat-up mapping drone," Meier says. It's a lot smaller and can only carry a quarter of the weight the other drone can, but it worked. All they did was yank out the camera, replace it with a vial of anti-venom and launch it off in the afternoon for the Pampa Hermosa-Contamana test flight. It got to Pampa Hermosa in just over half an hour, and it flew back that night.

        Meier says it's the best outcome he could have hoped for. The mapping drone only costs about $3,000. "I was like, what were we thinking? What are we doing here bringing a $40,000 drone when this can be done with just a few thousand dollars?" he says. "I think we drank the Kool-Aid, buying the hype and thinking more expensive and sophisticated means more reliable when it's still very early days [for] cargo drones."

        Instead of one specialized cargo drone, WeRobotics and their partners could furnish a drone fleet of about a dozen repurposed mapping UAVs. In Meier's view, the 12 little guys are better than one big one. "What we need is a network. You don't want just one. You want to service many towns," Meier says. And if one of the little drones goes down, for maintenance or because a bird or bad weather got it, 11 others are still in the air.

        Not even a swarm of drones will be useful in every situation, Lescano says, who is not involved with WeRobotics. The little UAVs can't fly in bad weather, and they would eventually be operating in a rain forest. "The amount of precipitation could be a big challenge for delivery over the rainy season," he says. But he's also: "We have very little alternatives to delivering care [in the Amazon], and this is really innovative and creative. The test is a proof of concept to move to the next stage."

        And they are going forward, Meier says. WeRobotics will be running more test flights — at least several dozen, maybe up to 100 — this week in Peru, and then again in May. This time, they're using an upgraded version of their mapping drone.

        Just slipping through on this sunny Saturday with an urgent fake-plant related announcement. Target has some really good fake fiddle leaf figs right now by Threshold. Three things:

            They seem expensive ($99 for the big one and $55 for the small one)
            In the store they look NEON green (like insanely bright and not-real looking at all)
            They’re in pots that are proportionally too small for them, and where the base of the plant meets the “dirt” looks super fake… but…

        … I bought a couple home to mess with them to see if I could get them to look more real for the beach house (since big real plants that renters have to water and/or would die in the off-season seems too high maintenance) and DUDE, it’s the jackpot.

        Here’s how to take them from looking super fake to believable:

            Put them in a bigger pot. I used cheap white Ikea planters I already had on hand. Once they’re in a larger pot it solves the proportion issue at the base, and it also makes them look lusher and leafier on the bottom, instead of seeing the weird stem down there (plus it hides the fake dirt).
            Bend & twist their stems & leaves to look more full. Straight from the store they’re super squished and not as believable, but you can adjust them into a more natural shape, which really makes a difference.
            Bask in the glory of them not being neon green in your house. Target’s super bright fluorescent lighting isn’t doing these guys any favors, but once at home when I put them right next to my real fiddle leaf figs the color is nearly identical. Real ones have brighter green leaves at the end (newer growth is brighter) which is one of the things that makes these such good fakes – they have those brighter end leaves too.

        Although the white planters I used are from Ikea (so cheap!) the little wheely plant stands are something we like to add to the bottom of ours (they’re much easier to rotate/move/etc that way). Also, here are our curtains, our rug, our swimming lady print, and cloudy landscape print for anyone wondering.

        But back to the faux figgies. There are two sizes at Target. A larger one that you’d probably put in the corner of a room or between two windows like this:

        And a smaller one that works on a fireplace mantel or on a tabletop or in the corner of a smaller space like a bathroom.

        At the end of the day, can you tell the real ones from the fake ones? Probably if they’re next to each other and your face is a few inches away. This is a real one on the left, next to a faker on the right (our real one has admittedly grown in a more irregular shape):

        But unless you plan on putting a real & a fake one side-by-side in your house for some reason, my verdict is that they’re pretty dang believable. Fiddle leaf figs are a good plant to mimic because the real ones have super waxy leaves – so glossy plastic leaves actually look a lot like their real leaves. I’ve tricked more than a few people with mine so far… and we’ve only had them a week.

        So if you have a room that gets a lot of light and could support a real fiddle leaf fig, and you can keep a real one alive (read more on how I do that here) – go for it! But if you don’t have a room full of light (they don’t work well in medium or low sun) or you just keep murdering innocent plants… these are the next best thing I’ve found in 5+ years of peering quizzically at all of the options.

        And although they’re not cheap, they are a pretty good deal as far as large fake plants go (this one from Williams Sonoma is $225 and this one from Wayfair is $135). Plus, a real one of this size might cost $69+, so the largest Target fake one for $99 might be worth the fact that it won’t ever keel over on ya.

        So yes, I bought five of them (two big ones and three small ones) because I’m hoarding three for the beach house in case they stop selling them (and I’m using two of them in rooms here that won’t support real fiddle leaf figs). Fake it ’til you make it, baby. Or ’til forever if your room is dark or your thumb is black. Whatever works.

        Oh, and if you can’t find them in the store (I had to hit a couple Targets to build my collection because they’re selling so fast) you can get free shipping on them online because both the bigger one and the smaller one are over $25. There’s really not any risk because you can just bring them back to your local Tar-jay if they arrive and you can’t make ’em work. Which is why I also just ordered ten bathing suits from them online (so I don’t have to see my pasty legs under those fluorescent fitting room lights and can hopefully find one I don’t hate). And yes, they’re all black.


        This is from the LA Times and it isn't very promising for public sector unions. Thanks to Jeff Kaufman for sending it out.

       A conservative group has joined with eight California educators in a lawsuit filed this week that seeks to eliminate the right of unions to collect mandatory “agency fees” from teachers — even if they are not full members.

       Similar litigation challenging the fees failed last year when the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4, leaving the current policy in place. If this latest litigation were to reach the court following the confirmation of an appointee by President Trump, teachers unions could lose a key source of funding.


       Agency fees, which are employed by unions in 23 states including California, are meant to cover the cost of representing teachers in such things as salary and benefit negotiations. Teachers can opt out of the portion of membership dues for activities labeled as political, but they still are on the hook for about two-thirds of the total.

       For Los Angeles teachers, full union dues are $988 per year.

       We pay well over $1,000 in NYC.

       With this and a national right to work law being introduced in Congress, one would think the UFT would show some urgency about defending our union but President Michael Mulgrew said basically we are exploring legal options to fight right to work. They should be talking about working with the membership to show them the value of a union.

           Oh well, we deserve it. I for one hopes the uft goes down in flames. They have been useless the few times i asked for assistance, and I am someone who has zero negative ratings and attendance better than 99 percent of city teachers. The teachers are complicit in allowing the disastrous situation we are in because of lack of knowledge, stupidity, not reading the contract, voting in the same people over and over, the list goes on and on...

           Unfortunately, the UFT is not worth a nickel, yet they have a gall to charge us $1200 a year in dues. The bulk of that money would be justified if they would get their membership contracts that were lucrative and improving of our working conditions. Sorry, but a 1% raise doesn't qualify as lucrative. And I were working conditions have only gotten worse over the years.
           So therefore, they have no right to charge us this outrageous some of money as dues, which is so obviously just going to pay THEIR lucrative salaries.

           We ran a poll last week asking if you thought the Jacksonville Jaguars would have Julius Thomas on their roster for opening day of the 2017 NFL season. The results were a lot closer than I imagined they would be.

           1,405 of you voted — 53% said Thomas would be on the roster, 47% said he wouldn’t.

           There seems to be a polarizing view of Thomas who had (justifiably) high expectations coming in two years ago, but who has failed to live up to those expectations. After flourishing with the Denver Broncos and Peyton Manning, Thomas has started just 17 games in two years and racked up 76 receptions for 736 yards and nine touchdowns.

           For a guy who signed a five-year, $46 million deal with $24 million guaranteed, that’s... well, it’s not good.

           Can some of Thomas’ disappointing production be tied to legitimate factors like having Blake Bortles as a quarterback and injuries? Sure. But let’s not sugar coat this — Thomas was signed to be a playmaker and while showing flashes, he has been little more than a role player.

           But does that mean the Jaguars should just up and cut him?
           The case for keeping Julius Thomas

           Tom Coughlin and the restructured front office means everyone is getting a fresh start, and that includes Thomas — who will undoubtedly be used more effectively for what he is with new offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett. Gone are the days of the 5-yard curl up-field. Well, hopefully they’re gone.

           And the salary cap savings are negligible. We have tens of millions in surplus as it stands. The Jaguars aren’t a good enough team yet to be cutting guys who are still in the top half of the team in terms of quality just because they’re overpaid.

           Thomas should not be looked at as a guy who will throw up double-digit scores in a given year, but if Thomas can be used more effectively and if we can temper our expectations we’ll be pleased with what we have (even if we paid too much for him).
           The case for cutting Julius Thomas

           Julius Thomas has been everything you fear a high-priced free agent will be when your team signs him: lazy, ineffective, and injury-prone. Newly hired Tom Coughlin will look for a sacrificial lamb to make a point about his culture and his way of doing things and Thomas is on a short list of guys who would be perfect to complete the task.

           The culture is bad here in Jacksonville. Gus Bradley let it become one of the worst in the NFL. Winning isn’t everything. Getting better is everything. Losing happens, I guess. How is Coughlin and this new coaching staff going to develop the players still worth a damn on this roster if they let guys like Thomas stay collecting checks?

           And speaking of young guys — what has Thomas given you in the last two years that Neal Sterling and Ben Koyack haven’t?

           The cap savings aren’t a factor, but salvage what you can from his contract and use it elsewhere.
           What do you think?

           Should the Jaguars let Thomas go? Or is his potential worth at least one more year in Jacksonville?

           This Valentine’s Day we wanted to change things up! We decided instead of telling you about a bunch of products that are red and have hearts, we would tell you all about the kites that we LOVE. These kites have genuinely brought some happiness to our lives, whether through family time or just simple serenity. Take a moment to check out some of our favorite kites and the fun ways that we get out to use them.

It has tails that you can add to it, or just fly it by itself in almost any wind.  My kids love the moving tail and play games trying to catch it!”

           Listening comprehension is the base skill, in my view. We have to understand in order to be able to have conversations with people. If we have good comprehension skills, speaking skills are easier to develop. Here is an exchange on this subject from our Forum at LingQ.



               Hi Steve:

               I have a few weeks before I start a class that requires students to understand speeches given by French-speaking presidents and world leaders. My French comprehension is, honestly, at about 70 to 80% at the moment.

               I have a tutor who records 30-minute monologues on subjects that I am interested in, so the input is interesting and compelling. He speaks at native-level speed, and the expressions and sentences are not made any easier just because I’m a student.

               But, today, I went to the Elysee’s website to watch “Le Point Presse,” which is similar to the “Press Briefings” held at the White House, and I had trouble following along. I also couldn’t follow some of the speeches by François Hollande.

               While I understood about 80% – that’s not enough. I need to be able to clearly understand the points these speakers are making so I can discuss them in class. I can’t discuss what I haven’t understood.

               Am I fighting a losing battle? I don’t know how much improvement I can expect over the next two months, but in order to pass this class, I need to be able to listen and understand this highly educated and deeply-idiomatic French.

               Admittedly, for the past two months, I haven’t been listening to much French because I was focusing on exams. But now I have more time to dedicate to this goal. I feel like I am soooo close, but yet so far away. Let me know what you think.

               Thanks a million,

               David


           Here is what I answered David:



           1. First of all, you can improve a lot in two months, so relax. The more relaxed and confident you are, the more you enjoy your listening and reading, the better you will do. Make sure you listen a lot, at least an hour a day, whenever you have the chance while doing other tasks. Do so in a relaxed manner. Choose content that interests you, and focus mostly on the meaning. Seek to learn about the subject matter of what you are listening to. The language improvement will largely take care of itself. However, there are some things you can do to make it even better.



           2. Maintain your reading activities, whether it is material for which you have the audio or not. Reading is a powerful way to increase vocabulary. Besides, when we read in a foreign language, we usually subvocalize, in other words we make the sounds in our heads. This is going to help your listening comprehension.



           3. If possible, try to find content that has matching audio and text so that you can look up words or phrases that you are missing. This is not necessary but helpful. However, don’t limit yourself to this. You can’t always find such material, so in your reading and listening use different sources, a newspaper article here, a podcast or interview there. Try to stay within a narrow range of topics which cover more or less the same vocabulary, in your case current events and politics.



           4. When you find audio content that you like, where you are interested in the subject and like the voice, listen more than once to the same audio material. If you like the voice, the intonation and the rhythm of the language will penetrate your mind better. I have found that this not only helps with pronunciation but also with comprehension.



           5. Plan to tackle some longer content in your field of interest. This could be an audio book on history or current events for which you have the text. You can then import the book into LingQ and save the audio to your mp3 player or smart phone. Make sure you like the voice of the narrator and find the subject interesting.


           I have found that interspersing short material with a longer book is powerful. I improve in my overall ability, and going to the longer book, regularly, is both enjoyable, and helpful. The comfort of a familiar environment, as I grow accustomed to the voice and context, gives me confidence and improves my overall listening skills. There is also a great sense of satisfaction when we complete the book. The feeling that we have climbed a mountain.



           6. Wherever possible, while listening or reading for meaning, try to focus on a few phrases or terms that you have just discovered, or just noticed. This helps the brain retain these expressions and will improve your listening comprehension. It also ensures that you stay focused.



           7. When you are at an intermediate or higher level in a language, you need to speak a lot. If you have a tutor, get him or her to give you a google doc with your mistakes and with phrases that cause you trouble. Import these into LingQ to study as content. You will then pay more attention to these words and phrases in your reading and listening. This makes your listening more focused and gives it more resonance, as you come across words and phrases that you once tried to use.



           8. Most of all remain relaxed, focus on enjoyment, and be confident that you can improve your listening comprehension a great deal in two months if you remain committed to these activities.

           President Donald Trump's Executive Order to temporarily suspend entry into the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries has been the subject of much controversy... to the say the least.

           Not to mention, President Trump has pledged to push forward with his plan to build a wall along the Mexican-American border, declaring his intention to deport all illegal immigrants.

           But let's put aside the debate on whether this is a wise choice made in the interest of safety or a fear-inducing one attempting to cause a distaste for diversity. Instead, let's talk about how thousands of restaurants are reacting to this news and how immigrants have transformed the restaurant industry to date.

           In response to the recent immigration controversy, restaurant owners, workers, and goers have all voiced their opinions on the relationship between restaurants and immigration. Here's what you should know.

           In the Beginning: International Influence on American Cuisine

           The restaurant industry encounters immigrants in America more than most other industries. Not only do immigrants make up a good number of the restaurant industry's workforce, but some of America's most popular restaurants pride themselves on serving more - well - "worldly" food than hamburgers and Coca-Cola.

           sushi-eat-japanese-asia-47546.jpegCrepes, kabab, chicken tikka masala, and sushi all have something in common.

           Their roots are not American.

           Before Chipotle and Domino's came around, there were the culinary experts of countries like Mexico and Italy.

           Their successes and food innovation are the reasons why pizza, tacos, and burrito bowls are so beloved (and accessible) by Americans today. Along with their enthusiasm for a new world of opportunity, these immigrants from hundreds of years ago brought something even more special to this country - their culture.
           RELATED POST: A Taste of the World - The Global Importance of Food & Dining

           Fast forward to today, and some of these internationally-inspired restaurants are not owned by immigrants. Instead, they are helmed by a citizen whose family came to this country generations ago. But even though that owner or manager is not an immigrant themselves, it doesn't mean their business is no longer impacted by immigration.

               26.3 million of these individuals hold a job, accounting for 16.7% of the country's workforce. (source)
               1.4 million immigrants work in restaurants. (source)
               An estimated 1 in 5 cooks and 1 in 3 dishwashers in restaurants are illegal immigrants. (source)

           Given these statistics, there's a good chance that if you're a restaurant owner, you employ (or have employed) at least one - possibly several - immigrants in your establishment. And whether you know it or not, they may not be here legally.

           So how does this affect your business?illegal immigrants in restaurants

           Well, although he could have been slightly exaggerating, Anthony Bourdain said that if all illegal immigrants were deported, "every restaurant in America would shut down."

           Bourdain continued by saying, "It is really, really getting hard to find people to do the jobs," referring to the difficulty of filling what are commonly seen as less-than-prestigious positions within a restaurant.

           Andra Zeppelin, who works with Eater's coverage of Denver, reinforced this idea.

           “People say immigrants are taking away jobs from Americans," she says. "Restaurateurs in Denver will tell you there are no people who want these jobs."

           So, regardless of legalized immigration status, it appears that immigrants are indeed helping the restaurant industry by taking low-paying jobs and supplying another set of hands in the kitchen.
           What Restaurants Are Doing

           When it comes to the travel ban, some restaurants are suffering. Others are sticking it to the man.

           Kabob Bazaar in Arlington, VA is owned by Bruce Sarvghadi of Iran. His employee (and brother) Davood attempted to return from a trip to Iran, but was temporarily barred from re-entering the country when the suspended entry program took place. This caused a disruption to Sarvghadi's scheduling and operations.

           On the ban, Mr. Sarvghadi said, “I’m just worried the way that things are going in this nation, with Mr. Trump in power. I’m hoping that the people will speak out and he will change his mind about his hard policy. Of course, we all want a safe place to live in, but I think the way that he’s going is a little too extreme.”

           Other restaurants are aiming to take a more proactive approach and let their patrons know just what kind of role immigrants play in their dining experience.

           Take a look at what Brooklyn restaurant Kiwiana, specializing in food from New Zealand, now features on their receipts.



           The tweet was quite popular with the public. Users commented back with positive messages about the contribution immigrants make to this country.

           When it comes to the legal side of the issue, some restaurateurs are choosing to embrace E-Verify to keep track of legal status. E-Verify is a way to take extra steps in making sure your employees have the proper legal status and offers some guidelines for protection if one of your hires is in this country illegally.

           The National Restaurant Association is aiming for a more streamlined approach, and wishes to work with President Trump's administration for an "easier and more cost-efficient" verification process.

           Additionally, some restaurants have chosen to register as a sanctuary restaurant.
           Sanctuary Restaurants

           Sanctuary restaurants are making a statement against immigration-based discrimination. Dozens of restaurants across the country have joined this movement, pledging to help workers understand their rights. These restaurants are taking a stand against the intolerance that many have associated with the ban.

           According to their website, sanctuary restaurants:

               "...have a zero tolerance policy for sexism, racism, and xenophobia. We believe that there is a place at the table for all. Sanctuary Restaurants is a joint project of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United and Presente.org with participation by dozens of restaurants nationwide."

           However, it's important to note that sanctuary restaurants have no power to knowingly and unlawfully harbor immigrants who are here illegally. The word "sanctuary" references the days when churches would provide protection. These restaurants provide sanctuary in the forms of knowledge and comfort.

           A map of sanctuary restaurants in the United States.

           Today, sanctuary restaurants aim to provide resources and information to all immigrants so they know their rights. The website continues:

               "Note: Sanctuary Restaurants is not a legal designation. Sanctuary Restaurants offer support and resources to workers, restaurants, and consumers to help create the world we want to see – a world free from hate, discrimination, and harassment."

           Moving Forward

           Ambiguity isn't my strong suit, and so I sympathize with all restaurant owners when I say that the future of immigration in this country is still unclear. With plenty of gridlock in Washington between branches, it's tough to know what will happen over the next four years (and long after that).

           But one thing is certain: immigrants have had an enormous impact on the culture of American food for hundreds of years, and they continue to play a role in that food's production in restaurants nationwide.

           Written by: AJ Beltis

           AJ Beltis is a Content Marketing Specialist for Toast. His first job in the restaurant industry was at a local pizzeria that kept him around through high school and college. When he's not writing about tips and trends for restaurateurs, he's probably watching TV or one of his favorite movies for the 50th time. He loves to travel and experience all the different kinds of toast the world has to offer.

           We write today to provide an update on how the recent Executive Order (EO) on immigration and refugees will affect North Korean refugees and our work.

           The EO suspends the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program globally for 120 days, for a review process to “determine what additional procedures should be taken to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States” (Sec. 5.a).

           North Koreans who have escaped the most repressive country in the world are not exempt from this suspension, meaning North Koreans seeking refuge in the United States will not be able to gain admission during at least the next four months.

           We know from experience that it is already not easy for North Koreans to gain refugee status to resettle in the United States as there is a strong vetting process currently in place. It can take many months, even over a year, and involves repeated in-depth interviews and screenings by various U.S. government agencies. We therefore believe it to be unnecessary and unfortunate to suspend the entire U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and further delay the start of these refugees’ lives in freedom.

           We are proud of our work helping North Korean refugees in their escape and assisting them in reaching countries like the United States and South Korea where they can begin new lives in safety and freedom. We are thankful to all our supporters who have made this work possible and have welcomed these individuals into their communities. It has been incredible to see our North Korean friends here in America learn English, enroll in universities, get married and begin families, find gainful employment, and even start their own businesses.

           A while ago we asked Anna–a North Korean refugee who we helped resettle in the US–her thoughts as she celebrated Independence Day. She said, “This country accepted me, embraced me, and gave me an opportunity to spread my wings.”

           Today, we renew our commitment to protecting North Korean refugees and to helping them resettle in societies where they can live in safety, freedom, and dignity and live fulfilling lives as valuable members of their new societies.


           Thank you, as ever, for your support.

           I’ve just landed home after nearly a month living in the Olympic Athlete Village in Rio. At the airport, I even tried to use my athlete credential instead of my passport to check into my flight. A shift back to the real world will start for me now. But before too many of my memories fade, I thought I’d share a glimpse of life — the athletes, the food, the condoms — from the Olympic Village.

           Hall Pass
           When I arrived at the Village, I was given a credential which is the most powerful hall pass ever. I could flash it at any venue and access the athlete locker room at any competition. I could also use it to get my hair done, visit the dentist, open the door to any vending machine, or get my laundry cleaned (all free) in the Village. I guarded this credential with my life, and now it is nothing more than a laminated plastic souvenir.

           The Apartments
           The Village is filled with a cascade of tall, newly balconied apartment buildings. Every building (except the Team USA building, which opts to be low-key) was dressed in country-specific flags — China, Qatar, Czech Republic. The Australian building even had life-size kangaroo and emu statues outside.

           My Greek team and I shared a building with Croatia, Algeria and Ethiopia, among others. The Croatian staff could always be found in the lobby of our shared building smoking cigarettes and jovially watching the Games on television from beanbag chairs. House music thumped from the balconies above at all hours of the day and night.

           I had four suite-mates and one roommate. My room was small, dressed in IKEA head to toe, but I turned it into my home. At the end of the Games every athlete took their custom Rio Olympics bed comforter with them — mine took up half a suitcase.

           The Daily Uniform
           All athletes wore their team sweatsuits at all times — this was a requirement enforced by each national team’s mission chief. The Italians’ were Armani. France, Lacoste. Sweden, H&M. The Slovakians’ sweats had colorful squiggly circles and squares printed on them that may or may not have been designed by Lisa Frank. My sweats were mostly Mediterranean blue. I even got a Greek fanny pack. My favorite item was my rain jacket, blue with tiny white Greek-keys printed all over it. By the end of the Games, the smell of bug spray was permanently infused in its fabric.

           Security
           At every corner, the Village was patrolled by camouflaged gunmen. When I waved at them they would smile and wave back. I got used to guns, as they were everywhere.

           I would leave the Village most days to train, compete or watch other competitions. Each time I came home from the outside world I had to get my credential scanned, my photo checked against my face, and my belongings scanned in a bomb detector. The security line was a great place to trade pins and make friends with fellow athletes returning home from their Olympic adventures.

           Visitors
           Only athletes and those with specially marked credentials were allowed in the Village. Each country was allowed 12 visitors per day, who were only permitted in the Village from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. — their passports were held to make sure they left before bedtime. I invited my coach to visit one day and deliver a special ice vest for my race. I also got the chance to show my entire family the Village, and they spent two hours people-watching in the dining hall where an athlete from Djibouti asked my brother for pointers on how to use chopsticks.

           Buses
           There were buses that circulated the perimeter of the Village at all hours, but the easiest way to get anywhere was to walk. Plus, if I didn’t walk to and from the dining hall every day, I wouldn’t have gotten an epic photo with Usain Bolt.

           Bicycles
           Many of the European delegations, as well as Canada, brought small collapsible bikes to scoot around the Village campus. It was important to watch out for mini pelotons of bikers whizzing across the walkways.

           The Epic Dining Hall
           I spent a lot of time in the dining hall, a colossal temporary white structure that resembled a holiday cake roll. Inside, I found tubs of quail eggs, halved passion fruit and other worldly prepared foods and condiments. I learned the hard way that the giant bucket of yellowish stuff next to the cold cuts was not honey mustard, it was dulce de leche. This dining hall never closed, and it was the best place to people watch.

           In the dining hall, I saw team jackets from every possible country — Sri Lanka, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Dominican Republic, Lesotho, Morocco, Nigeria, Croatia, Japan, South Korea, Ecuador, Myanmar — everyone in their specific colors, like a Wes Anderson film. Even though I often ventured to the dining hall alone, I always managed to find someone to meet and eat with. One day, I sat with Katie Ledecky, who liked to eat lots of bacon. I later watched in awe as she won several gold medals.

           Meeting Other Athletes
           I loved guessing an athlete’s sport by looking at them. I loved learning about their sport even more— I met a Cuban who told me about that his event — doubles canoeing — is being phased out of the Olympics next year, which means he won’t be back (unless he becomes very good at a different event).

           I got the courage to ask Venus Williams for a photograph. Her hair was dyed USA-red — I loved it.

           No matter what country or sport, athletes can tell when other athletes needed their space. After all, today could be their big day. If they were carefully twirling their pasta noodles on a spoon, or seemed to be moving either very quickly or very slowly, that probably meant today was the biggest day of their life. When I saw Michael Phelps with his hood up and headphones in, I didn’t bother him.

           The Gym
           It was common to see a table tennis player, a rower, and a swimmer all bobbing up and down on the elliptical while watching Netflix. A gold medalist dropped his iPhone and it shot off the back of his moving treadmill. A table tennis game blasts on the floor-to-ceiling television – after a particularly intense point, every athlete in the gym stopped in his or her tracks, in collective awe at watching a fellow Olympian doing something completely foreign to them. The Village gym looks like a normal gym, except for the range of body types and activities that fill it.

           The Secret Athlete Game Lounge
           When athletes are not competing in their sport, they might be found competing in traditional game room fare in the athlete game lounge. This building is somewhat hidden, but once you find it you have access to free condoms, Dance Dance Revolution, and all the limited edition athlete-only golden Coca-Cola bottles you can get your hands on.

           But even when you remove an athlete from competition, you can’t take the competition out of them. When you challenge a Russian weightlifter to a game of ping pong (like my dad did), you will probably lose. Even though there is not a medal at stake here in the game lounge, it is nearly impossible for Olympic athletes not to try their best. It comes from the same immutable competitive instincts as my determination to always peel my oranges in a single peel. We can’t help it.

           The Medical Tent
           I visited the medical tent for an ice bath every day, and each time I shared a tub with someone from a different sport and different country than me.

           While inquiring about the free dental exams, I met a volunteer doctor from Brooklyn named David. He called the International Olympic Committee every day for a year to get the chance to live and work for free in the village. He told me that the reason that doctor and dentist offices were so packed at all hours of the day is because for many athletes and coaches from less-developed parts of the world, this was the first doctor’s appointment they’ve had in four years — since the last Olympics.

           Romance
           In the Village, after the competition is done, things get fun.

           The reason the condom machines never ran out was because there was a condom fairy who roamed around with a knapsack full of condoms with the sole purpose of keeping the condom dispensers stocked. The dispensers read “celebrate with a condom” in three different languages.

           I often saw athletes wandering hand in hand at sunset along the shoestring of waterways that laced between the 20-odd residential buildings. Once it was dark, the parties began — often in the pool outside my building, and always well past my bedtime.

           Morning walks of shame were not uncommon, with an athlete wearing mismatched country clothes scurrying across one of the walkways between the thousands of balconies and waving flags.

           Opening and Closing Ceremonies
           I’m glad I went to both, but my favorite was the Opening Ceremonies.

           As a Greek, I entered the stadium first. I wondered if this is how Rihanna feels at her concerts? I tried not to cry, but every time I made eye contact with any person, I cried.

           At the center of the stage, a smiling person dressed entirely in green approached me and offered me a small oval pellet: a tree seed. She guided my hand towards a cardboard planter box and I planted the tree right there on the stage. For a moment, I forgot about the thousands of people around me and just focused on the little seed.

           Famous Last Words
           When you leave the Village, “thank you” is not the word you use. Though you feel all sorts of emotions and gratitude for your experience, thank you is not enough. You won’t use traditional summer camp goodbye rituals — it’s not a teary goodbye. It’s not the time, either, to dwell on the ups and downs from this Olympics. This Olympics is over, forever sealed in a vault in our hearts and minds.

           The best thing to say — the only thing to say — is “see you in Tokyo.”

           only 1 in 4 cars in the US have a backup camera. By federal mandate, every new car sold in the US by May 2018 is required to be equipped with one, but lots of drivers rightfully want to add a camera to the car they drive now.

           Watch out for hidden costs though. Most aftermarket backup cameras require an invasive install: either a costly professional job or a time-consuming personal project. Either way, you can end up with holes drilled in your car, reverse light wires spliced, and cables running through your car to an extra display (even more $$$).

           RearVision is completely wireless and uses your phone as the display. On average, it takes about 10 minutes to securely install and the only tool you will need is a screwdriver to remove your license plate. With our 30-day, free-returns trial period, it’s super easy to try out.

           Check out the video below to see a side-by-side comparison of the installation process.

           After the install is done, RearVision is smarter than your average backup camera. RearVision’s obstacle alerts are a built-in alternative to aftermarket parking sensors (*another* costly and invasive install). RearVision also gets better over time. Each update of the Pearl App provides a new features, like the recently launched Smart Parking Guidelines.

           RearVision’s not only going to save you a lot of time and money by avoiding a complicated installation, it provides a tremendous value compared to other options.

           When it comes to furnishing your office, selecting a desk that meets your personal needs is a great place to start. After all, it’s where you typically spend most of your workday. With a variety of features and add-ons to choose from, it’s essential to consider the factors that are most important to you before you buy. Here are some of the key features you may want from a desk, and how you can get them into your office sooner rather than later.
           Storage

           Storage space is a very popular office luxury right now. If you’d like to cut down on all the freestanding storage taking up space in your office, a desk with built-in storage may be your answer. It not only allows for a more coherent style, but it can also help contain the storage items in a single area.
           Desk with built-in storage

           Double-pedestal desks offer two different storage cabinets built into the legs, leaving a cutout for the knees. A single pedestal desk offers less storage but more knee space, depending on the size of the top.

           If you have a corner that can accommodate the height of a hutch, an L-shaped double-pedestal desk with a hutch greatly maximizes storage capabilities vertically, instead of horizontally. It also allows for more desktop space for laying out and sorting materials.
           Space savers

           To maximize your space even more, a workstation that holds the computer, printer and a few shelves provides a compact desk option. It doesn’t have the storage capacity that a conventional desk does, but as far as saving space goes, it does the trick.

           For tablet and laptop-centric businesses that don’t require the use of a pc, an even skinnier option is the wall-mounted fold-up desk. Often seen in medical facilities, they are also becoming popular furnishing pieces for students’ and children’s rooms. Certain models are made to carry the weight of a laptop while others are not. Be sure to check the description before purchasing.
           Standing desks

           For those who are concerned about the long-term effects of sitting at a desk for hours every day, standing desks are a viable alternative to the sitting desk.

           Attachment pieces, like adjustable arms made for use with a laptop, can have your existing workspace going from sit to stand within seconds. More than just a height adjustor for the monitor, such attachment pieces are versatile for a raised (or lowered) partial desktop.

           Even better is a fully adjustable desk that can move the entire top from sitting to standing and vice versa with the turn of a handle. They may not have the storage capacity of some other desks, but if you want a multipurpose desk that caters to your health, it’s a win.
           Special-purpose desks

           Depending on what it is you do at your workstation, your desk may require special features beyond what a typical desk can provide.

           A drafting and drawing table is designed with an adjustable tilted top for those who will be using a pen or pencil at least as much, if not more, than they will a computer. Most drafting tables are stool height and do not provide desk space for a laptop or PC, but a rare few do.

           In order to lay out materials for design or cutting purposes, a standing or stool-height work table, often with height-adjustable legs, is convenient. While there is typically little to no attached storage, the broader top allows for rearrangement of items as needed.

           If mobility plays an essential part in your everyday work, a sturdy wheeled workstation may be more to your benefit. Storage is usually limited on mobile workstations, but some options come with shelving to accommodate extra materials.
           New desk, new you

           The items you choose to furnish your office with can make a big difference when it comes to feeling comfortable and increasing productivity. There are a few basic requirements every workspace will typically need, which means for many years desks were standardized and general. Fortunately, there are now so many different options available, which means choosing a desk can be a lot more individualized.

           With the Holiday Season in Full Swing, we are filled with anticipation and excitement for all that it brings. Let’s be honest, the things that make the season beautiful are the little things, the smells, the music, the parties, the great company, the ambiance. Thanksgiving, the holiday I love most because there is no pressure for gift giving, just good old family traditions of football watching, cooking too much food, and sharing the things you are most thankful for – Just being together. Because when we look back at our life these are the moments that matter. And within these moments is an ambiance that let’s you go back – and that ambiance is built from the details.

           The one detail, so easily overlooked, but when absent, everything feels off kilter, is a rug. This detail is literally like the icing on the cupcake, without it, it’s just a mundane super sweet muffin, but with it, WITH IT - it’s a CUPCAKE. Honestly, this cannot be overstated. Yes, it is coming from a Rug Enthusiast, but I really want every day Americans to embrace the importance that a rug places on a room. It is the base of the ambiance, it sets the tone and anchors the space.

           But what rug to choose – there really are so many. I wanted to highlight a style that melts in with almost any décor these days. Today more than ever Antique Reproductions are being used in traditional homes but also transitional and even contemporary homes. They are reproductions of classical designs, sometimes with an aged look which adds to their vintage appeal and makes them calmer and a bit more inviting. Their colorways are up to date and on point – which is why they are comfortable in most any setting.

           Here are my top 5 Antique Reproductions:

           But really why antique reproductions? What is it about them that makes them so attractive and timeless? I have thought about this for a while now and here is my conclusion. There is a certain nostalgia we feel when we see traditional rug designs – credit for this can come from spending the holidays at Grandma’s house, opening gifts on the big traditional rug or it could be from the numerous movies that have played through our life. Think - A Christmas Story, The Big Lebowski, The Money Pit, even Aladdin – all these movies take us back to the good old days. Timeless and Classic, it is no mistake that Persian designs never take a back seat in the rug world, they may evolve a bit, but they will never go away. We celebrate this. Because everyone can feel comfortable and welcome with this look and during the holidays, this goes a long way.

           Go and Be Joyful – spread peace and thanksgiving to all with whom you come in contact with. For we will look back at these days and remember all that created them.

           Cheers!



           Last month we were approached by award winning, independent television company Raise the Roof Productions during their search for a new and interesting craft to feature in the upcoming show.

           During the show, Kirstie works with Modern Souvenir sculptor and Creative Project Coordinator Charlotte Hern to produce a five-pointed star tree decoration using the moulding and casting process. Together they produce one segment of the star, create a mould and produce five casts to form the complete star. The aim of the task is to show viewers how to produce unique, beautiful decorations at home.

           The TV appearance coincides with the firm's new brand launch last week - changing from Revival Arts of Bath to Modern Souvenir.

               “We were delighted that Kirstie’s production team chose to visit Modern Souvenir as one of the leading traditional craft workshops in the South-West. Kirstie was fascinated by the processes we use and entered wholeheartedly into the spirit of creating original, miniature works of art for the Christmas home!”

               Our favorite things to do on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship balcony
               In:

                   Staterooms

               13Feb2017

               There are many great stateroom choices when booking a cruise, and certainly a room with private balcony is one of the most intriguing options. Having your own private space to enjoy the view of the ocean, a gentle breeze and the activities in port are a fabulous way to spend any cruise.

               In addition to just the view, there are some really fun things to try when staying in a balcony room.  Here are some of our top picks for favorite things to do on a balcony while on a Royal Caribbean cruise.
               Enjoy a meal

               Royal Caribbean puts tables on the balcony for a reason, and enjoying a meal outdoors is always a really fun way to enjoy a meal while onboard.

               Room service is included in the cruise fare, so you might consider ordering a snack or full meal to be delivered to your stateroom.  When the waiter brings the food, direct them to bring it to the balcony and they will be happy to set it up for you there. In fact, if you are staying in a Grand Suite or above, meals from the main dining room can be delivered to your room as well.

               Another option is to bring something back from elsewhere on the ship to enjoy on the balcony. A few slices of pizza from Sorrento's, or just a plate of goodies from the Windjammer are always good options.  Guests can bring food from pretty much anywhere onboard and take it to go for enjoying on the balcony.  We really love bringing Izumi sushi back to the balcony to eat with a fabulous view.
               Watch a show

               On Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas, Allure of the Seas and Harmony of the Seas, there are balcony rooms that offer a full or partial view of the AquaTheater, which has some truly impressive physical feats on display in a variety of shows.

               Each ship has rather large suites that overlook the AquaTheater perfectly.  Granted, these suites are not inexpensive, but many guests love having an unfettered and private area just for them to enjoy the view of the ocean and the AquaTheater.

               Likewise, there are standard Boardwalk Balcony staterooms towards the rear of the ship that also provide a view of the AquaTheater.  Some of these rooms will offer partially blocked or full views of the AquaTheater action too.
               Bring drinks back

               Just like food, enjoying a few cocktails on your balcony is a great way to take advantage of having a private balcony.  It is easy enough to grab some drinks from somewhere onboard and bring them back to your stateroom to enjoy.

               Whether it is sailaway and you are enjoying a toast to the best cruise ever, or just want to get away from the rest of the crowd and sip some bubbly while you watch the waves pass by, enjoying a drink on a balcony is a wonderful way to spend time onboard.
               Read a book

               You can read a book anywhere on a Royal Caribbean ship, but there is something extra relaxing about pulling up a chair, propping your feet on the balcony and opening up a great book to enjoy.

               Reading a book while the ocean breeze passes you by is nearly as relaxing as one of the services offered by the Vitality Spa, and usually quiet enough to become immersed in the story unfolding between the pages.
               Go in the hot tub

               Certain suites on Royal Caribbean ships actually come with their own hot tub, which means you always have a reserved spot to enjoy the calming warm waters of your own Jacuzzi.

               Just like the AquaTheater suites, suite staterooms that have a hot tub are not going to come cheap, but if you value having the best kids of accommodations onboard, it is hard to go wrong with a hot tub that only you can get to use.  Our scientific research team assures us that nearly any view is better in a hot tub.
               Watch the sun rise and set (many times)

               If you are not enjoying the spectacle of the sun rising and setting at least a few times during your cruise, you are missing out.  When you have a balcony stateroom of your own, you can see one of nature's most beautiful events with the utmost convenience.

               Granted, your balcony will need to be facing the east or west to witness this occurrence, but if things do line up, be very certain to take advantage of it.




               I ran my first race of 2017 today.

               Alright, I jogged it. And walked it. I jog/walked it.

               It’s called wogging.

               I wogged my first race of 2017 today!

               This is a 2017 intention I plan to keep: to run (wog!) one 5k each month this year. The idea is that I should see improvement over the 12 months, leading to greater self esteem and (perhaps) a slimmer waist.

               The slimmer waist will be TBD, but I’m sure I’ll improve my time! Let me explain.

               There were two good options for a fun run at the end of January: one run was to help people pay their electric bills, the other’s purpose was to get a free beer afterward…Dang that guilty conscience!

               So. (much to my beer-drinking-husband’s disappointment) on January 1st I enthusiastically signed up for The Race for Warmth! I’ve got a whole month to train! I can do this! I used to run all the time! I’m sure my muscles remember how to do this!

               I spent many a minute fondly remembering the energy of a race. The anticipation at the starting line, the mental endurance games when the race seems long, the final-flying kick at the end. Visualizations aside, the actual running, you know, to prepare for the race…yeah that didn’t happen so much.

               Insert SNOWPACOLYPSE 2017. Now, there was some snow earlier this winter, but this time, it actually, truly snowed in Vancouver/Portland.real-snow-2real-snow-3real-snow

               Do you know what the snow management plan for the Vancouver/Portland area is?

               Wait for it to melt.

               Yep.

               Not, PLOW or SALT or perhaps PLOW! Just…wait.

               So, that plan works if the snow melts. But what happens when temperatures stay below freezing for a week?

               The snow stays.

               That’s what happens.

               So, stay it did. 8 snow days later, had I accumulated any miles to go along with those inches of snow?

               Heck no! I don’t own Yak Traks! Plus, drivers out here are crazy in inclement weather.

               Also, I got the plague. Well, if the plague means hacking up a lung for 3 weeks (which I know it doesn’t, hyperbole!). Coughing and running don’t exactly work well together, so, run I did not.

               But, time still passed. And every day I got closer and closer to race day. Until, fancy that, the day actually arrived.

               “I CAN’T!” I wailed and moaned. “I’ve run a total of 2 miles in preparation for this race.” That’s right. The entirety of my preparations (stretched over a month!) were not even as long as the actual race.

               “You can,” said Andy. “Take it slow. Walk if you have to. You’ll be happy that you did.”

               I hate it when he’s right (actually, I love it. Cause my brain tells me I’m wrong about all sorts of things, and he’s a good litmus test for my kind of crazy).

               Let’s review: the day of the race arrived and I

               1. had not run 3 miles since, oh, I don’t know 2010?
               2. had 2 year old running shoes (they don’t break down, right?),
               3. was still wheezing and coughing my way through long conversations, and
               4. realized the race was in the morning, when it was going to be 36 degrees outside.

               Race for Warmth… blarg.

               So, what I’m trying to say is I set myself up for absolutely nothing less than complete success.

               If by success I meant utter failure, pneumonia and a pulled hamstring.

               But, you know what happened? None of those things.

               The energy at the start was the same, the exhilaration of starting something together, something difficult? It was infectious, and before I knew it, I was swept up in the crowd, jogging my first run in a long time.

               Then I walked. Then I jogged. Then I walked. Then I jogged (wogging, remember?) So on and so forth until, suddenly, I finished!

               All that worry, and all that whining, and here I was. Already done.

               Now, my time was not stellar, but, as I said in the beginning, there is plenty of room for improvement. And it probably won’t snow again in Portland this winter… probably.

               Time to sign up for my February race.

               And get new shoes.

               And get rid of this cough.

               And, maybe run a mile or two… once I can feel my legs again.

               Posted on January 28, 2017	by Caitlin @ TOTE

               “I don’t usually let people in here, but I don’t mind if you come in,” she said, as she looked for something in her office. In direct contrast to the rest of her organized home, this room had stacks of paper. Piles of things. It was a holding space for transitionary items.

               It was a space that showed me, contrary to all outside appearances, that even she had a messy place.

               And I was honored.

               It is both humbling and gratifying when people show me truth. Show me messy. Show me the spaces that not everyone gets to see. Because it is so real. Messy is my reality. Everyone has their spaces of chaos, the areas that hurt a little to show. We’re all afraid to be vulnerable, afraid of being judged.

               But this friend knew she was safe from the judgements and the sideways glances. Because I first showed her my reality, my messiness.

               I picked “simplify” as my word for 2017. Motivated by whitewashed walls, clean lines, capsule wardrobes, I vowed to be the same. I can paint. I can clean and polish and scrub and cull.

               Except, I can’t. Not really.

              Our fascination with rainbows is nothing new, but applying this unique and always changing finish to the home certainly is.

The result is a unique iridescent application to both metals and plastics that will allow anyone to bring a piece of this new colour trend into their home.

              Natural stone is coveted by many, but affordable ways to include these materials in the home are difficult to find. Through new production applications, the umbra team has found a way to create the look of natural stone in molded plastics. All cans sold in North America are made in North America.

              Perpetual Motion is one of the most notorious pieces in Suzuki Book 1. Just say the name to any violin teacher or Suzuki parent and you'll get a heavy sigh. "Oh, THAT one." When I tell people that I have 8 students all at some stage of Perpetual Motion, I get condolences.

              It's true, Perpetual Motion haunts my sleep. Out of sheer survival instinct, I've developed a variety of ways to both prepare students for Perpetual Motion so that when they actually learn it on the violin, we get through the piece in a matter of weeks.

              1. Singing

                  The first thing students do is listen to Perpetual Motion and learn to sing it.
                  I always have my students write their own words to their Suzuki Book 1 songs. The rules are simple: one syllable per note, to keep the rhythm steady, and the words can be anything they want. This helps the student be expressive, connect to the rhythm and pitch pattern, and remember the order. If you assign different words to repetitive phrases, they'll be easy to remember.
                  Singing in solfege. I teach my students to sing solfege syllables on scales and other patterns from the first lesson. By the time they're at Perpetual Motion, singing their songs in solfege is a normal thing for them. Singing in solfege also helps them connect to the relationship between the pitches.
                  IF your student is reading all the notes in the A Major Scale by this point, you can also have them sing note names.



              2. Scales and Finger Patterns

                  I make sure that my students can play an A Major one octave scale, the arpeggios, and the scale in broken thirds.
                  I also do a ton of finger patterns featuring broken thirds and fourth fingers.
                  We do the A Major Scale in two different bowings: martele in the upper half for the Perpetual Motion singles, and then detache doubles in the middle of the bow for the doubles. This prepares the bow strokes.


              3. Basic Technique

                  If a student is struggling with basic elements of technique such as left hand position, holding the violin up, or bow hold, I correct these through review songs or supplemental repertoire before tackling Perpetual Motion.



              4. Awareness of Musical Form

                  The large scale form of Perpetual Motion is A B C A (using 4-bar phrases). That can be broken down into a a' b b' c c a a' (using 2-bar phrases). I write this on the music for the student and sing through the piece with them so they can see where exactly each section is.
                  I always point out that the difference between a and a' is that a ends on the note E and a' ends on the note A. The same goes for b and b'.
                  Any awareness of patterns will help build the connection between the student and the piece.



              Once you've prepared the student to sing the song in a variety of ways, trained their fingers to do all the patterns required in the piece, and trained the bow to do the different bow strokes, teaching them the actual piece goes much, much smoother.

              I hope this helps students, parents, and teachers who are working on Perpetual Motion, and I'd love to hear any tips or tricks you have for teaching it!
              Creating Enthusiastic and Independent Practicers: Taking Ownership

              7/16/2014

              Wow. I can't believe how many views I had on the first post in this series. That's what putting "Disney" in the title of a post will do for you, I guess. I hope we get just as many on this one, because just buying things with music and violins on them is only part of the practice puzzle. If you're just joining us, check out Part 1 here.

              The second piece is having your children take ownership of their violin playing. If your child is old enough to play violin, they're old enough to be taught ownership. Sometimes, when you're a kid, you feel like your life is completely controlled by the adults around you (and let's be honest - it usually is). That can result in a feeling of powerlessness. If violin is something that a kid feels they have no control over, it will almost certainly be one of the things that they use when they start testing their limits.  I have quite a few students in my studio who are creative, intelligent kids who love violin but refuse to practice because it is something their parents want them to do, and they're at the stage where they don't want to do what their parent tells them, regardless of whether it's cleaning their room or practicing violin.

              An important public service announcement: Violin should always, always be more the child's thing than the parent's thing. Being a violinist is the child's identity. We want our kids to play violin because they love it, want to make music, and want to play well. They should never feel obligated to play to live out their parents' dream or to fit into some pre-determined notion of what the perfect child does. Music is not a box to check on the list of well-rounded extracurricular activities. It is a passion, and creating art is one of the highest privileges of being human.

              It's true that there will be stages where the parent needs to motivate the student and keep them practicing when they rather wouldn't, but playing the violin should at its core be something that the student wants for their life. There is a big difference between not wanting to play music and not wanting to practice.

              Violin lessons (like pretty much everything) start with the parent doing everything for the child and end with the child doing everything. This process takes years, especially if the student starts young. Remember that your eventual goal is to have your child driving themselves to lessons, practicing independently, organizing their own schedule - and one day, even paying for their own lessons (if they continue to play through college and into adulthood).

              So, how do you teach your kids to take ownership of their violin playing? You start from the very first day.

                  Have them carry their own instrument. Violins come in fractional sizes for a reason. If they're old enough to play the violin, they're old enough to carry the case responsibly. No matter how much they whine, no matter how much they drag their feet, make them carry their own violin. It's an important part of the bonding process between violinist and violin, and essential for ownership.
                  Students should prepare their own violin and bow for playing. They should open the case, attach any shoulder rest or sponge, and tighten/rosin the bow. Very young children will need to be guided by their parents in this, but learning proper care and  setup of the instrument is critical. They need to learn it as soon as possible!
                  Students should fill out their own practice charts. If your teacher gives you a practice chart, let the student take responsibility for checking off each item on the chart as you complete it. If your teacher doesn't give you a practice chart, check The Practice Shoppe and have the student fill in their assignments! If your child isn't comfortably writing yet, the parent can fill in the chart, but the child should check everything off. Let them choose a special pen or a colored pencil or crayon to mark off the chart.
                  Let students choose the order of practice. Let your child choose what to do first. The rule should be that they have to do everything on the chart, but they can pick the order.
                  Give your child a choice about when to practice. Whether or not the student practices should not be a choice. Except in extreme circumstances, practice is every day. However, you can give the child a choice about when they are going to practice. One of my parents told me that she gives her son a choice: Either he can practice before his tv time OR he can practice right after dinner. If he chooses not to practice before tv time, then he must practice after dinner.
                  Involve your students in the communication process with the teacher. As soon as they're old enough, the student should be the one emailing the teacher with questions or with scheduling issues. It can be from the parents' email account if they don't have their own, but the student should take responsibility for communicating with the teacher. If the student isn't old enough, they should sit with the parent while the parent contacts the teacher and give input. Again - ownership. It's their violin lesson.


              The point of all of this is to help your student feel like violin is theirs. Once a student really takes ownership of their violin playing, they will feel a sense of ownership and pride. Knowing that they can set a goal for themselves, create a plan to accomplish that goal, and execute their will build true self-esteem and confidence. They will be healthier, happier, and more responsible human beings and dedicated, creative, passionate musicians.
              28 Days of Practicing: Resources for Students at Every Level

              10/22/2013

              This project is designed for students at every level, from the five-year-olds in my beginning class (and their parents), to professionals. The reflection questions are very open-ended and relevant to all, and often, modifications are given for the more advanced practicer. For example, during Week 2: Putting In The Time, students are challenged to practice every single day. However, for a student who already practices on a daily basis, they might have a goal of practicing for a certain amount of time every day.

              I also want to list some supplemental resources that students and parents may find helpful as they prepare to explore the world of their practicing:

              We typically make dozens of decisions a day--what to eat, what to wear, with whom to socialize, short term planning, long-term planning, small and large life decisions and the list goes on. But some decisions are harder to make than others, whether because of our mood, our motivation, the situation, or the specifics of the decision itself and its implications—we just become stuck. We feel paralyzed and keep putting off the decision, which makes us feel worse and more pressured, which makes us feel even more paralyzed.

              Here are the steps to take when you are struggling to make a decision:

              1. Define the decision and the steps required to make it. Example: You don’t know if you should go on a vacation because finances have been tight and you’re not sure you can find something in your budget that will be worthwhile. What you are debating is not Should I go on vacation? or Where should I go on vacation? But Will the best vacation that fits my budget be worth the expense? In other words, sitting down to define the decision will make you realize it has two distinct steps: First you have to find the best option that fits your budget and only then will you be able to decide if it will be worth the expense.

              2. List the options. Remember to include non-actions as options. For example, you have to decide whether to invite someone you’re not super close with to your birthday party. There are three options: You can decide to invite them, you can decide not to invite them, and you can avoid making the decision. For those of you quick to point out that not making a decision is basically the same as not inviting the person (as they don’t get invited either way) that is true factually but not psychologically. Unmade decisions can be sources of distraction and stress and the more of them hover over us, they more we are burdening ourselves unnecessarily.

              3. List the pros and cons for each of the options. Make sure to consider as many perspectives as possible. For example, when listing the pros and cons of going home for the holidays or staying put and celebrating with friends, consider your experiences of holidays past, both ones in which you went home and ones in which you did not. Consider whether you will then be obliged to visit at another time instead and whether that visit will be better or worse, consider the feelings of other family members, the feelings of your friends who will not enjoy your company, the logistics of travel or cooking, etc…

              4. Come up with a decision deadline. Some decisions have time urgency. For example, deciding whether to accept a new job offer or stay in your current job, or deciding whether to join friends on an unplanned weekend trip when you had planned to catch up on schoolwork. Other decisions have more open timelines, such as deciding whether to go on a diet, clean out the attic, or join a social media platform. When dealing with non-urgent decisions, either impose an artificial deadline for making the decision or if you feel unready to do so, decide to defer the decision to a later (specific) date when you will revisit the issue (so it doesn’t hover over you as an outstanding task).

              5. Visualize the different options. We often make decisions based on our gut but let’s make sure to give our gut enough information to work with. Find a quiet spot, close your eyes, and in your mind, play out each of the options before you in graphic detail (i.e., take the time to truly paint the scene—the more detail, the more real it will seem, the truer your gut read will be). For example, if you’re deciding whether to buy an expensive item of clothing you really want but cannot really afford, envision what it would be like to get the item and wear it in a specific circumstance but also envision looking at your empty bank account, having to forgo something else you might have wanted, or the stress of big credit card bills until you pay it off.

              6. Put it all together. Now that your gut has a better read on what you should do, choose the option you are leaning toward most. If you suspect your decision was more emotional than rational (i.e., one made by your gut) proceed to the next step. If not—you have made your decision.

              7. Sleep on it. If you think your decision was motivated by emotion (e. g., “I kind of shouldn’t but I really want to!”) get a good night’s sleep and go over the pros and cons again the next day to make sure you’re not succumbing to impulse.
              We're hiring passionate interns for the summer to help us organise the events.

              It's a great opportunity for anyone who is interested in gaining experience in the events. We caught up with Monika, Intern Manager, to get a deeper look into life as an intern on The Yacht Week.

              What inspired you to get involved with TYW?

              I first found out about TYW through my roommate who showed me the famous trailer in 2013 and it always stuck with me. I took a year off uni to do internships and when I was researching the kind of companies I wanted to work with, TYW came up so I went ahead and applied to be a summer intern in 2015. The rest is history.

              How do you think TYW internship differs from a regular 9-5 job?

              It pulls you completely out of your comfort zone. I had never been to Croatia before TYW and I got to make it my home for 5 weeks rather than experience it as a tourist. The internship gives you an in-depth look at what running an event of this scale is like.

              In terms of working for TYW outside of events, I love it because it has that family start-up feel. I think everyone envisions a massive office but we're only 35 people in London so you're given the opportunity to grow with the company and experience event management from all angles.

              What is a typical day in an intern's shoes?

              It runs on more of a weekly schedule, than a daily schedule. But you wake up (sleep in a little) and have breakfast together. You might be travelling in the mornings to a different island and then normally in the afternoon we do boat hopping where we chill with the guests and tell them a bit about the plan for the day. Later on, we set up for night events and just make sure the vibes are good.

              After doing 23 TYW events you must have met thousands of people... do you feel like you now have connections around the world?

              I think that's one of the greatest things you take out of working the events. You are recognisable to 200-1000 people with your blue shirt. You go around to every boat introducing yourself and making incredible connections. I've even heard stories of skippers and interns doing trips around the world and not paying a cent for accommodation. Yacht Weekers are typically between the ages of 24-35 so it's also a time to network for work or passion projects.

              Within TYW staff, you become a family, it's not just colleagues. You are thrown into such a unique and utopian environment that friendships are quickly forged....real friendships

              Being away from home, and reality in a sense, did it put a new perspective on life when you came back to the 'real' world?

              I think the beauty of The Yacht Week is that when you're at the events it's a fresh start – you're around completely new people. It's an opportunity for you to reinvent yourself. You don't carry the baggage of your past or your 'real life' because it's 'nothing like the real world'. Your perspective on friendships, priorities, communication etc changes in one way or another. You might even find some challenges within yourself but you come out of it having done something so unique that the rest of the world seems different.

              As much as The Yacht Week is an escape from reality, you return with a fresh take, a few new tricks up your sleeve and an entire community of people behind you. The big and scary 'real world' that we all face somehow seems just a little bit smaller and a little bit easier to take on.
